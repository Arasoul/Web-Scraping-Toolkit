The move sent ripples through financial markets and could complicate President Donald Trump’s efforts to cut taxes.', 'The Moody’s rating agency dropped the US government’s credit score by one notch from the pristine Aaa to Aa1. It cited rising debt and interest costs “that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns.”', 'Last week’s cut followed a downgrade by rating rival Fitch, which lowered the US credit score by one notch in 2023. Fitch was the second major rating agency to strip the US of its AAA rating after Standard & Poor’s did so in 2011.', 'Investors use credit ratings to assess the risk profile of companies and governments. The lower a borrower’s rating, the higher its financing costs.', '“Successive US administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,” Moody’s said in a news release last week.', '“Over more than a decade, US federal debt has risen sharply due to continuous fiscal deficits. During that time, federal spending has increased while tax cuts have reduced government revenues,” it said.', 'The downgrade marked the first time Moody’s has lowered Washington’s credit score since 1949, the year it began rating US government debt.', 'Since his return to the White House in January, Trump has said he would balance the budget while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has repeatedly said the administration is aiming to lower its borrowing costs.', 'But Trump’s attempts to cut spending through Elon Musk’sDepartment of Government Efficiencyhave fallen far short of its initial goals. As things stand, Washington’s debt is growing by about $1 trillion every three months.', 'Meanwhile, it is not yet clear if attempts to raise revenues throughtariffs– which sparked concerns about a trade war and global slowdown – will work. Most economists think they won’t.', 'For decades, US government bonds have served as the global “risk-free” benchmark for other financial assets. Increasingly, however, that is being called into question.', 'According toUS Department of the Treasury data, a whopping 16 percent (or $684bn) of tax revenues were used to cover debt interest payments this year. In Germany, by comparison, that figure is closer to 4 percent.', 'Looking ahead, Moody’s said it expected the US federal deficit to widen to 9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035, up from 6.4 percent in 2024, “driven mainly by increased interest payments on debt… and relatively low [taxes]”.', 'It anticipated that the federal debt burden will rise to 134 percent of GDP by 2035, compared with 98 percent in 2024. For context, the debt-to-GDP ratio reached a record of 133 percent in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Still, Moody’s maintained that the US “retains exceptional credit strengths such as size, resilience and dynamism and the continued role of the US dollar as the global reserve currency”.', 'In a statement, White House spokesman Kush Desai said: “If Moody’s had any credibility, they would not have stayed silent as the fiscal disaster of the past four years [under President Joe Biden’s leadership] unfolded.”', 'The White House characterised Moody’s downgrade as politically motivated. White House communications director Steven Cheung said Moody’s chief economist, Mark Zandi, was a critic of Trump’s.', 'Trump is pushing lawmakers in Congress, which is controlled by his Republican Party, to pass a billextending tax cuts introduced in 2017. Those cuts, which were his signature first-term achievement, slashed corporate and individual taxes.', 'Moody’s recent downgrade came as a bill to prolong those tax cuts failed to clear a procedural hurdle on Friday as some Republicans in the House of Representatives demanded deeper spending cuts and then blocked the measure.', 'Then, late on Sunday, the holdouts dropped their opposition and allowed it to pass through committee. The tax proposal is now one step closer to a vote by the full chamber.', 'Moody’s said the fiscal proposals under consideration were inconsistent with a sustained reduction in the deficit and ongoing tax reduction talks would raise the debt burden to 134 percent of GDP over the next decade.', '“Moody’s downgrade of the United States’s credit rating should be a wake-up call to Trump and congressional Republicans to end their reckless pursuit of their deficit-busting tax giveaway,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on Friday.', '“Sadly, I am not holding my breath.”', 'Moody’s downgrade stoked fears of a broad investor reappraisal of US sovereign debt. As demand for assets falls, so does their price. Yields (investor returns from lending money to the government) then move in the opposite direction.', 'On Monday, benchmark 10-year yields – which influence mortgage rates and borrowing costs for companies and consumers – rose to more than 4.5 percent. They have come down a little since then. Longer dated 30-year bonds also saw a jump in yields.', 'While Moody’s announcement sent jitters through US stock markets on Monday, they have largely recovered over the past two days. Gold, meanwhile, rallied almost 1 percent to $3,220 an ounce but then trended down on Tuesday and Wednesday.', 'Elsewhere, the value of theUS dollarfell back against a basket of currencies. The\\xa0British pound, for instance, rose to its highest level against the greenback since the start of May – to $1.35.', 'Lower credit ratings typically lead to higher bond yields, which will raise interest rates on everything from mortgages to car loans to credit card debt because commercial banks use government bond yields as a basis for setting their own interest rates.', 'This is crucial for Americans, who are among the most highly indebted people in the world. In 2023, US household debt relative to GDP clocked in at 73 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund. Switzerland, Australia and Canada have household debt-to-GDP ratios in excess of 100 percent.', 'If the US government continues to spend more on rising debt repayments, it will have less for public spending on things like Social Security, healthcare and defence as it becomes more costly for the government to sustain itself.', 'Washington could raise taxes to generate more revenue to pay down its debt. But Trump appears to be headed in the opposite direction – lowering both taxes and public spending.', 'Sovereign credit warnings, including last week’s, chip away at investor confidence. Losing AAA status from all three major rating agencies is a symbolic blow to American prestige.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

In the past 16 months, more than 400 alleged Maoist rebels have been killed in Chhattisgarh state, home to a sizable population of Adivasis (meaning original inhabitants or Indigenous people).', 'But activists are alarmed: They say many of those killed are innocent Adivasis. And campaigners and opposition leaders are urging the government to cease fire and hold talks with Maoist rebels to find a solution to the decades-old issue.', 'More than 11,000 civilians and security forces have been killed in clashes involving Maoist fighters\\xa0between 2000 and 2024, according to official figures. Security forces have killed at least 6,160 Maoist fighters during the same period, according to police and Maoist figures.', 'So, will the government’s hardline approach help bring peace, or will it further alienate the Adivasis, who are already one of the most marginalised groups in the country?', 'The armed rebellion in India originated in a 1967 rural uprising in the small town of Naxalbari, located in West Bengal state. The word Naxal comes from the town’s name.', 'Led by communist leaders Kanu Sanyal, Charu Majumdar, and Jungle Santal, the armed uprising called for addressing the issues of landlessness and exploitation of the rural poor by landlords.', 'The three leaders founded the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) (CPI(ML)) on April 22, 1969, to wage armed rebellion against the Indian state. They believed that their demands were not going to be met by the prevailing democratic set-up.', 'The Naxal rebels were also inspired by the revolutionary ideology of the Chinese leader Mao Zedong. Modelled on the Chinese communist party’s approach to capturing the state, they waged a violent rebellion against the Indian security forces in mineral-rich central and eastern India for decades. The West Bengal government, led by Congress leader Siddhartha Shankar Ray, launched a fierce campaign to suppress the Naxalite uprising.', 'I once again assure the countrymen that India is sure to be Naxal-free by 31 March 2026', 'byAmit Shah, home minister', 'Sanyal, one of the founding leaders of the movement, told this reporter in 2010 that “by 1973, at least 32,000 Naxalites or sympathisers had been jailed across India.”', '“Many were killed in fake encounters. And when the Emergency was declared in June 1975, it was clear- the sun had almost set on the Naxalite movement,” he said. He died in 2010, aged 78, apparently by suicide in Siliguri.', 'Over the years, the CPI(ML) splintered into multiple parties, more than 20 of which still exist. The main CPI(ML) itself gave up armed struggle, expressed faith in the Indian Constitution and began participating in electoral politics. Currently, it is a legally recognised political organisation with several legislators.', 'Meanwhile, in 1980, one of the splinters, the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) People’s War, was founded by Kondapalli Seetharamayya and Kolluri Chiranjeevi in Andhra Pradesh.', 'Another major breakaway faction, the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC), had a base in Bihar and West Bengal states. In September 2004, the MCC and CPI(ML) People’s War merged, resulting in the formation of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), the largest armed Maoist organisation in India today.', 'The organisation’s most recent general secretary, Nambala Keshava Rao, alias Basavaraj, was killed by security forces on Wednesday in Bastar, Chhattisgarh – the last stronghold of Maoists.', 'The BJP-run Chhattisgarh state government has adopted a more aggressive stance against Maoists compared with the previous government led by the Congress party.', 'At least 141 Maoists were killed between 2020 and 2023, when the Congress party was in power, but after the BJP came to power, security forces claimed to have killed 223 alleged Maoists in 2024 alone, according to government figures.', '“For the past 15 months, our security personnel have been strongly fighting the Naxals,” Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai told Al Jazeera.', '“This action is part of the broader efforts, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, to make India free from Naxalism. This is a decisive phase, and we are advancing rapidly in that direction,” he said.', 'The security forces have currently surrounded suspected Maoist hideouts in Karigatta Hills, with the army’s helicopters assisting in the operation, according to authorities.', 'Whether it’s the Maoists or the DRG, the one who kills is tribal and the one who dies is also tribal', 'byFormer Member of Parliament Arvind Netam', 'On May 14, India’s Home Minister Amit Shah announced the killing of 31 fighters in the Karrigatta Hills.', '“I once again assure the countrymen that India is sure to be Naxal-free by 31 March 2026,” Shah reiterated in his post on X.', 'Overall, nearly 66,000 security personnel spanning a range of paramilitary and special forces have been deployed in Chhattisgarh.', 'The latest operation, which involves more than 10,000 soldiers, centres around the mineral-rich Bastar region of Chhattisgarh, which spans 38,932 square kilometres (15,032sq miles) – an area nearly the size of the US state of Kentucky.', 'The government has set up approximately 320 security camps in Bastar alone – home to three million people. The number of personnel at each security camp fluctuates depending on the requirement: It can be as low as 150 personnel and rise up to 1,200. They include security forces, as well as technical staff.', 'Security camps are often equipped with surveillance and communication equipment to assist in the operation against the rebels. The 20,000-strong local police force is also helping in the operations in Bastar.', 'The use of cutting-edge technology, such as advanced drones equipped with high-definition cameras and thermal imaging sensors, has helped security forces monitor Maoist activity in the region’s dense forests.', 'However, local villagers allege that security forces have carried out aerial bombings in various parts of Bastar using large drones. Maoist groups have also accused the forces of conducting air strikes.', 'Security forces have consistently denied these allegations.', 'Shah, the home minister, has made frequent visits to Chhattisgarh, even spending nights with security forces in Bastar.', 'But the federal government of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who preceded Modi in India’s top executive office, had also taken a tough stance against Naxals.', 'Singh even called Naxalism the “greatest internal security threat” to India, and his government launched a major crackdown in 2009 under what it called “Operation Green Hunt” to quash the armed rebellion. Amid allegations of human rights violations, Indian security forces managed to reduce the terrain controlled by the Maoists.', 'In the 2000s, Naxals controlled nearly one-third of India’s mineral-rich tribal areas, known euphemistically as the Red Corridor, straddling the states of Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Odisha, Jharkhand and Maharashtra, among others. But the number of districts where Maoists wield significant influence had declined from 126 in 2013 to just 38 by April last year.', 'As the government claims success in its military offensive, human rights groups such as the People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) accuse the security forces of carrying out fake encounters or extrajudicial killings.', '“A large-scale military campaign is being carried out under the pretext of eliminating Maoists,” Junas Tirkey, the president of the PUCL in Chhattisgarh state, said.', '“Since 2024, violence, human rights violations, and militarisation have increased sharply in Bastar. Innocent tribals are being killed in fake encounters,” he told Al Jazeera.', 'Since 2024, violence, human rights violations, and militarisation have increased sharply in Bastar. Innocent tribals are being killed in fake encounters', 'byJunas Tirkey, president of the PUCL in Chhattisgarh', 'The PUCL has identified at least 11 incidents as fake encounters over the past one and a half years.', 'On March 25, police claimed it had killed Maoist rebels Sudhakar alias Sudhir, Pandru Atra, and Mannu Barsa in Bordga village, Bijapur, about 160km (100 miles) east of Bastar.', 'But villagers allege the police’s version is false. They claim that the police surrounded the village at night, took 17 people away, released seven, shot three, and took the remaining seven with them.', 'The government has denied the allegations, but no independent investigation has been conducted in this case. The regular magisterial inquiry, which is carried out after so-called encounters, is not considered credible by rights groups and tribal communities as it is largely based on the police version of events.', '“It’s true that Sudhakar was a Maoist and came to visit someone in the village. But the police captured Sudhakar, my brother and others alive, took them away, and later shot them, falsely declaring it an encounter,” the brother of Mannu Barsa, Manesh Barsa, told Al Jazeera.', 'Inspector general of police of Bastar region, Pattilingam Sundarraj, disagreed with these allegations. He claimed that Maoists often pressure locals to fabricate accusations against the police following encounters.', 'However, multiple so-called encounters in Bastar have been proven fake in the past, and in most cases, justice has evaded victims.', 'Even if they are eliminated from Bastar, Maoism is an ideology that cannot be defeated through violence alone', 'byFormer DGP Vishwaranjan', 'Out of thousands of so-called encounters in Bastar in the last 25 years, only two have faced judicial inquiry. On June 28, 2012, 17 Adivasis, including six minors, were killed in Sarkeguda village in Bijapur district. On May 17, 2013, four minors were among eight Adivasis killed in Edasmeta village in the same district.', 'The inquiries led by High Court judges found all victims to be innocent. The reports were released in 2022 during the previous Congress rule, though no police cases have been registered against any personnel to date.', 'Even peaceful protests against mining projects and the militarisation of the region have been met with harsh crackdowns.', 'The Moolvasi Bachao Manch (MBM), led by Adivasis, was banned last year for “opposing development” and “resisting security forces”.', 'Dozens of Adivasi youth associated with MBM have been arrested since 2021.', 'The recruitment of Adivasis, many of them former Maoists, in recent years by the authorities seems to have turned the tide in favour of the government.', 'The then-BJP state government started to incorporate Adivasis, particularly former Maoists, in the District Reserve Guard (DRG) force in 2008 with the aim of using them in anti-Maoist operations. The idea: Former Maoists are better at navigating dense jungle terrain and know about Maoist hideouts.', 'But past records have raised concerns. Adivasis enlisted as Special Police Officers (SPOs), as they were called, have been accused of rights violations.', 'In 2005, the state government ruled by the Congress government launched a campaign against Maoists called Salwa Judum (meaning “peace march” in the local Gondi language). Salwa Judum members were armed and were later designated as SPOs and paid 1,500 rupees/month ($17/month).', 'On one hand, the government itself had proposed dialogue with the Maoists. But now, that same government has turned Bastar into a warzone', 'bySoni Sori, Adivasi activist', 'But Salwa Judum members faced accusations of rape, arson, torture and murder. In 2011, the Supreme Court declared Salwa Judum illegal and slammed the state for arming civilians. Subsequently, many SPOs were absorbed into the DRG.', 'DRG personnel have also been accused of rights abuses, but such cases have rarely been investigated.', 'Campaigners have also questioned the policy of using surrendered Maoists in combat instead of rehabilitating them.', '“The manner in which SPOs were incorporated into the DRG is disturbing. It shows how tribal youth involved in violence were again handed guns under the pretext of rehabilitation,” lawyer and human rights activist Priyanka Shukla told Al Jazeera.', 'Former Member of Parliament Arvind Netam believes Bastar is “in a state of civil war”. In a situation like this, he says, it’s the tribals who suffer the most.', '“Whether it’s the Maoists or the DRG, the one who kills is tribal and the one who dies is also tribal,” Netam, a tribal leader, told Al Jazeera.', 'Campaigners have argued that Chhattisgarh’s new rehabilitation policy, which promises bounties and cash rewards, incentivises people to turn on each other for money, often with allegations that may be legally untenable.', 'Interestingly, while the government has intensified its offensive, it has also continued to offer peace talks to Maoists.', '“We still reiterate, Maoists should come forward for dialogue after laying down their arms. Our doors for talks within the framework of the Indian Constitution are always open,” Chhattisgarh’s Home Minister Vijay Sharma told local media last week.', 'The Maoists, however, insist on a ceasefire and withdrawal of paramilitary forces as conditions for talks. They argue that peace talks and military operations cannot run simultaneously.', 'In a statement, CPI (Maoist) spokesperson Abhay said, “The right to life guaranteed by the Indian Constitution is being crushed by the government itself … On one hand, our party is trying to initiate unconditional dialogue, and on the other hand, ongoing killings of Maoists and tribals render the peace process meaningless.”', 'Activists have raised concerns regarding the plight of Adivasi communities.', 'Soni Sori, an Adivasi social activist from Bastar, believes the government must take the initiative for peace talks.', '“On one hand, the government itself had proposed dialogue with the Maoists. But now, that same government has turned Bastar into a warzone,” Sori told Al Jazeera.', '“Given the way these operations are being conducted, the government should halt them, foster an environment conducive to dialogue, and take meaningful steps toward initiating peace talks.”', 'Human rights activists, academics and students have been targeted after being dubbed Naxal sympathisers.A 90 percent disabled professorfrom Delhi University,GN Saibabawas jailed for backing Maoists. Last October, he died months after beingacquittedby the country’s top court after a decade of incarceration.', 'But state Chief Minister Sai says there will be no leniency in this matter. “Naxal eradication is not just a campaign but a mission to secure Bastar and Chhattisgarh’s future,” he said.', 'In 2011, then-Director General of Police of Chhattisgarh Vishwaranjan estimated approximately 10,000 armed Maoists and 40,000 militia members in the Bastar region. Accurate numbers are hard to determine.', 'The rebels were able to carry out deadly attacks against the security forces. In 2010, they killed 76 paramilitary troops in a forest ambush in Chhattisgarh. Three years later, dozens of people, including the Congress leader who founded the Salwa Judum, were killed in a rebel ambush.', 'Current Bastar IGP Sundarraj P estimates about 1,000 armed Maoists remain, along with 15,000 affiliated individuals.', 'Internal Maoist reports acknowledge declining recruitment, smaller units, and ammunition shortages. Of the 40 central committee and politburo members, only 18 remain free – the rest are either dead or arrested.', 'Meanwhile, security forces have expanded, built new camps, and improved intelligence and training, while Maoists’ base areas are shrinking.', 'While our government is running an anti-Naxal campaign, we are also actively working on development projects', 'byVishnu Deo Sai, chief minister of Chhattisgarh', 'Former DGP Vishwaranjan says Maoists are weakened in Chhattisgarh, but they have expanded into neighbouring Madhya Pradesh.', '“Even if they are eliminated from Bastar, Maoism is an ideology that cannot be defeated through violence alone,” he told Al Jazeera.', '“As long as we build a society on economic inequality, the ideology may resurface in a new form.”', 'Defending his government’s policies, Chief Minister Sai said that “security and development go hand in hand.”', '“While our government is running an anti-Naxal campaign, we are also actively working on development projects,” he said.', 'Naxals have invoked the exploitation of natural resources, particularly through mining leases issued to global corporations, and the displacement of local communities, as their reasons for picking up guns in mineral-rich areas of the country. Thousands of Adivasis have been displaced and their local environments severely damaged due to mining activities.', 'Of the 51 mineral leases in Bastar, 36 are held by private firms, including global steel major ArcelorMittal.', 'Former MLA and tribal leader Manish Kunjam echoes a similar sentiment, arguing, “The real issue is iron ore.”', 'According to the Indian government, 19 percent of the country’s iron ore reserves are in Chhattisgarh, mainly in Bastar.', 'Chhattisgarh accounts for 18 percent of India’s railway freight revenue, largely from mineral transport – and this is growing.', 'Kunjam explained that when the corporations Tata and Essar began their projects in 2005 to mine iron ore, the state launched Salwa Judum, evacuating 644 villages under the pretext of Maoist fear. At least 350,000 people were displaced. However, strong tribal resistance forced the companies to withdraw.', '“Learning from that failure, the government has now set up security camps in mining zones, preparing for renewed extraction,” he said.', '“Without village council approval, mining cannot proceed. If tribals protest, they will be labelled as Maoists or sympathisers and dealt with accordingly.”', 'A closer look at his claims reveals that most camps are indeed in areas where mining has begun or is about to. In Bastar’s mining belt, there is one soldier for every nine tribals. Many of these camps are funded by mining companies.', 'But Chief Minister Sai believes that the mineral resources in tribal areas should be utilised.', 'The idea of generating revenue at the cost of tribal lives is dangerous and unconstitutional', 'bySushil Anand Shukla, opposition Congress party spokesperson', '“The lives of tribals will change with the beginning of mining and industrial activities,” he said. He boasted that Chhattisgarh ranks second among mineral-producing states [after Odisha], earning approximately 14.19 billion rupees ($1.71bn) last year.', 'This year, the state has allocated 48 major mineral blocks to private companies in the state.', 'But mass poverty and lack of basic health facilities expose the government’s claims.', 'Netam, the tribal leader, pointed out that the state has an infant mortality rate of nearly 38 per 1,000 live births, compared to the national infant mortality rate of 28 per 1,000 live births.', 'In Bastar, he said, poverty is 80 percent.', 'The opposition Congress spokesperson Sushil Anand Shukla claimed that under the guise of mining, preparations were under way to completely displace tribals from Bastar.', '“Today, Bastar stands on the brink of war, and its answers cannot be found by looking to the past. The government must stop surrendering to corporate houses and mining companies at the cost of evicting tribals,” Sushil Anand Shukla says.', '“The idea of generating revenue at the cost of tribal lives is dangerous and unconstitutional,” he told Al Jazeera.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

The framing is unsteady. And at one moment, another cellphone pokes into view to capture the scene.', 'But the video has nevertheless gone viral in Peru for one big reason: It captures a goofy, off-the-cuff moment with the new head of the Catholic Church,Pope Leo XIV.', 'On Sunday, the newly elected pope formally began his leadership of the church with an inaugural mass at Saint Peter’s Square in the Vatican.', 'His papacy has made history. Born in Chicago, Leo XIV is the first pope ever to hail from the United States. But for Peruvians in the northern city of Chiclayo, he is a hometown hero, and the viral video from 2014 is proof of his South American roots.', 'Under fluorescent lights and scattered decorations made of curling ribbon, Leo XIV — then known as Robert Prevost — warbles Christmas songs into a handheld microphone.', '“Feliz Navidad! Feliz Navidad,” he sings, backed by a guitar-playing band of Chiclayo youths, swaying to the beat. “I wanna wish you a merry Christmas!”', 'In the lead-up to his papacy, Chiclayo, Peru’sfifth largest city, has played a central role in Leo XIV’s rise through the Catholic Church.', 'Since 1985, Leo has served in various Catholic missions throughout the north of the country. But over the last decade of his career, Chiclayo has been his home base. He served as bishop there from 2015 to 2023, and during that time, he also became a Peruvian citizen.', '“He has earned the love of the people,” said Father Jose Alejandro Castillo Vera, a local church leader who first met Leo XIV in 2014.', 'But while the region has warmly embraced its “papa chiclayano” — its pope from Chiclayo — the situation in Latin America also reflects the struggles of Leo’s new post.', 'Catholicism is thought to be on the decline in Latin America. A survey from the public opinion firm Latinobarometro found that, from 1995 to 2024, the number of self-identified Catholics slipped from about 80 percent to 54.', 'And in Peru, public opinion suffered in the wake of a sexual abuse scandal that emerged in 2015.', 'Still, in Chiclayo, there is optimism that Leo XIV’s leadership can reinvigorate the Catholic faithful, given his track record of public service.', '“I think he can promote space for dialogue,” said Yolanda Diaz, a 70-year-old teacher in Chiclayo and national adviser for the National Union of Catholic Students.', 'She believes Leo XIV will help “move forward, little by little, the changes we want to see in the church”.', 'Leo XIV set the tone for his papacy early on. In his first remarks after his election, he switched from Italian to Spanish to address his adopted hometown directly.', '“If you allow me a word, a greeting to all and in particular to my beloved diocese of Chiclayo, in Peru, where a faithful people accompanied their bishop, shared their faith and gave so much, so much, to continue being a faithful Church of Jesus Christ,” he said.', 'Vatican observers quickly pointed out he opted not to address the US, his birth country, nor to speak in his native English.', 'In the days that followed, thousands of people poured into Chiclayo’s main square to celebrate the new pope, dancing and receiving communion in the shadow of its buttercup-yellow cathedral.', 'In the frenzy, local businesses spied economic potential. Ricardo Acosta, the president of the National Association of Travel Agencies and Tourism (APAVIT), proposed creating a pope-themed tourism route.', 'And restaurants in Chiclayo posted signs outside their door: “Aqui comio el Papa.” In other words: “The pope ate here.”', 'Poverty in the northern region of Peru affects nearly a quarter of the population. And local advocates have argued that the city and surrounding regions struggle with inadequate public infrastructure.', 'That problem was thrown into stark relief during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when the United Nationsreportedthat more than a thousand families in Chiclayo lacked access to drinking water.', 'Healthcare resources were also stretched thin. Peru had thehighest death rateper capita, with an estimated 665.8 deaths for every 100,000 people.', 'Father Castillo, the secretary-general of the Catholic aid organisation Caritas Chiclayo, remembers that Leo XIV played a critical role in raising money to buy medical-grade oxygen to treat the sick.', '“He came up with the idea of making a campaign to support the community, to acquire an oxygen plant,” Father Castillo explained.', 'Through their collective efforts, more than $380,000 were raised to buy the oxygen generation systems.', '“He appealed to the entire population, to the authorities and to the businessmen as well,” Father Castillo said. “In the end, God was so great that not only there was money for one plant, but for two oxygen plants.”', 'Both, however, have since been shut down due to a lack of funds for maintenance. Still, Father Castillo told Al Jazeera he hopes Pope Leo XIV will continue his advocacy for the poor while at the Vatican.', '“We are all hopeful that he continues to be that voice, not only for us Peruvians, but for everyone,” he said. “Many people need to get out of misery, out of poverty.”', 'For Diaz, the teacher, one of her fondest memories of the new pope was working together on another pressing issue facing Peru: migration.', 'Since 2018, Peru has become one of the leading destinations for migrants and asylum seekers from Venezuela, where political repression and economic instability have driven more than 7.9 million people abroad.', 'The United Nations estimates that Peru has absorbed nearlytwo millionof those migrants. That makes it the second largest recipient of Venezuelans in Latin America.', 'Diaz told Al Jazeera she witnessed the impact of that wave of arrivals in Chiclayo. She and Leo XIV worked together on a new commission he established as bishop to address migration and human trafficking.', '“We had a big surge,” Diaz remembered. “We saw up to 20,000 people arriving in Chiclayo, more than 3,000 families, including children and youngsters. You could see them sleeping in the main square, on the streets, in church entrances, outside travel companies.”', 'The influx has stirred up anti-immigrant sentiment among some Peruvians, resulting in reports of discrimination.', 'But Diaz observed that Leo XIV attempted to destigmatise what it means to be a foreigner in Peru when he visited migrant communities.', '“I’m a migrant,” Diaz remembers him saying. “I know what it means to arrive as a migrant in an unknown land, with a different culture.”', 'She saw that as evidence he can bridge divides in his new role as pope. “He understands there’s diversity in the church.”', 'But while Pope Leo XIV is largely seen as a unifying figure in Chiclayo, his papacy has reignited some lingering controversies within the Catholic Church.', 'Among the most damning are the allegations of sexual abuse in Catholic dioceses across the globe, from the US to Chile to Ireland.', 'The Catholic Church in Peru is no exception. Much of the scrutiny has centred on one group in particular, the Sodalitium Christianae Vitae (SCV).', 'It was founded in Peru in 1971 and grew to include members across Latin America.', 'But in 2011, the Catholic Church started to receive formal complaints about its founder Luis Fernando Figari and other leaders in the SCV movement.', 'In 2015, after years of investigation, journalists Pedro Salinas and Paola Ugaz published a book about the complaints that shocked Peruvian society and brought the issue to international attention.', 'Called Half Monks, Half Soldiers, the book detailed more than 30 cases of abuse, including allegations of psychological abuse, forced sodomisation and other harms committed in the SCV.', 'Ugaz told Al Jazeera that the future Pope Leo was supportive of her efforts to investigate.', '“Among the bishops who supported us until the end is Robert Prevost, an empathetic person who is aware that this issue is crucial to his papacy,” she said in a written statement.', 'Figari has consistently denied any wrongdoing. But Leo’s predecessor at the Vatican, Pope Francis, eventually sent two envoys to Peru, including an archbishop, to investigate the group.', 'In 2024, Peru’s church authorities released astatementconfirming that the investigation had found cases of “physical abuse, including sadism and violence” as well as other actions designed “to break the will of subordinates”.', 'Figari and other top members were ultimately expelled from the organisation. And later, Pope Francis took the rare step of dissolving the group altogether. The decree of suppression took effect just one week before Francis died in April, effectively abolishing the group.', 'But Pope Leo himself has faced scrutiny over whether he failed to act upon the complaints the diocese in Chiclayo received while he was bishop.', 'In March, for instance, a group called Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests (SNAP) issued aletteralleging that three women in 2022 reported their sexual abuse to the diocese, only to face institutional silence.', '“There is serious reason to believe that Cardinal Prevost did not follow the procedures established by the Holy See for carrying out investigations following reports of abuse,” SNAP wrote.', 'Leo XIV, however, has told the Peruvian newspaper La Republica in the past that he rejects “cover-ups and secrecy”. And last week, Father Jordi Bertomeu Farnos, a Vatican investigator, denied the reports.', '“Robert Prevost did not cover up anything,” Bertomeu Farnos told Peruvian media in Rome. “He did everything according to the protocols we have in the Vatican.”', 'Ugaz, the journalist, says she remains optimistic Leo XIV can implement reform.', 'She pointed out that, in his first days as pope, Leo XIV held a meeting with Cardinal Sean O’Malley, who leads a Vatican commission to protect children from abuse. She also recalled the words of encouragement he recently gave to her and her journalism partner.', '“He asked us to continue our work,” she said, “and to expect news about Peru soon.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

imitation so that someone in the West thinks that the peace process has begun, and that’s why there’s no need to help Ukraine, to pressure Putin and to impose new sanctions,” he said.', 'Putin also managed to escape a lull in hostilities that would have helped Ukrainian forces to fortify their positions along the 1,100km (700-mile) front line, according to Nikolay Mitrokhin, a researcher at Germany’s Bremen University.', '“Apparently, Putin succeeded in nullifying a very disadvantageous initiative by Zelenskyy to immediately start a 30 days-long ceasefire,” he told Al Jazeera.', 'While negotiating, clarifying and delaying the talks, Putin may try to seize more land in eastern and northern Ukraine and even restore the giant Kakhovka Dam that used to supply water to annexed Crimea before being destroyed in 2023, he said.', 'Meanwhile, Moscow has conscripted 160,000 servicemen and keeps recruiting some 50,000 soldiers monthly, in part thanks to the offer of hefty enlistment

[Moscow] may amass a new resource,” he told Al Jazeera.', 'Europe was unimpressed by what Trump and Putin agreed upon and introduced the 17th round of sanctions against Moscow on Tuesday.', 'Brussels and London said the sanctions would target Moscow’s “shadow fleet” of tankers, the financial institutions that help Moscow avoid earlier sanctions, and the supply chains for Russian arms producers.', 'However, the European sanctions will be less effective without US measures as Putin “acts in the divide-and-rule way”, Romanenko said.', '“He wanted everyone [in the West] to step aside from Ukraine, so that there are no arms supplies, and then he could carry out yet another imperial takeover” of Ukrainian territories, he concluded.', 'US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Tuesday that Trump is reluctant to slap new sanctions on Russia.', '“If, in fact, it’s clear that the Russians are not interested in a peace deal and they just want to keep fighting a war, it may very well come to that point,” Rubio told the US Senate.', 'He also insisted Putin “hasn’t gotten a single concession” from Trump.', 'Meanwhile, pro-Kremlin observers are ecstatic.', '“These were very successful talks.

But critics caution that the move could further entrench the military’s control over the country.', 'Islamabad, Pakistan –Pakistan’s cabinet on Tuesday promoted Syed Asim Munir, the country’s chief of army staff, to the rank of field marshal, following the country’s recent military conflict with India.', 'That short butintense confrontationhad brought the South Asian neighbours to the edge of their fifth war, as they launched missiles and drones towards each other over four days in early May.', 'Ultimately, aceasefire on May 10, announced by United States President Donald Trump, pulled the nuclear-armed neighbours back from the brink after they each targeted the other’smilitary installations in missile strikesearlier that day.', 'Both New Delhi and Islamabad claimed wins in the conflict. And Pakistan’s government has drawn a direct link between those clashes and its decision to promote Munir.', 'So why was Munir promoted, what does the rank of field marshal signify, and what does the promotion portend for the future of Pakistan’s military leadership and its role in the country’s domestic affairs?', 'According to a statement from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s office, Munir was promoted in recognition of his leadership of the army, with “exemplary courage and determination,” and for devising a strategy to counter Indian attacks.', '“In recognition of his brilliant military leadership, courage, and bravery, ensuring Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and courageous defence against the enemy, the cabinet approved the prime minister’s proposal to promote General Syed Asim Munir to the rank of field marshal,” the statement said.', 'The cabinet also granted a second extension to Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu, currently in his fourth year as head of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), following a previous extension.', 'Talal Chaudhry, state interior minister, told Al Jazeera that the decision to promote Munir was based on his leadership.', '“The Pakistani military was engaged on two flanks, fighting the menace of terrorism on our western borders, and during that, they also had to fend off our adversary on eastern flank, which has one of the world’s largest armies, and yet under Munir’s leadership, we came out on top decisively,” Chaudhry said.', 'In a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the military’s media wing, Munir said he was humbled by the honour and dedicated it to the “entire nation, the armed forces of Pakistan, especially the civil and military martyrs and veterans”.', '“This is not an individual honour but an honour for the armed forces of Pakistan and the entire nation,” he said.', 'A field marshal is the highest rank in armies – like Pakistan’s and India’s – that follow the British Army’s traditions.', 'Very. In Pakistan, a full general – denoted by four stars – is usually the standard rank for the army chief and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), who convenes the heads of all three services: army, navy and air force.', 'Although the CJCSC role is open to any of the three branches, only army generals have held the post since 1997, with General Sahir Shamshad the current incumbent in the role.', 'Since gaining independence in 1947, Pakistan has had 17 army chiefs. Munir is only the second among them – after Ayub Khan – to be promoted to field marshal.', 'Ayub Khan became army chief in 1951 and seized power in a military coup in 1958. A year later, he promoted himself to field marshal while appointing General Musa Khan as the new army chief.', '“A field marshal has his own insignia and their own stick which they carry with them. A field marshal does not have to respond to a salute, but instead they only have to wave the stick to acknowledge it,” Inam ul Rahiem, a lawyer and former military officer,\\xa0told Al Jazeera.', 'Once conferred, the field marshal rank is held for life.', 'Yes, and it is as rare in India as it is in Pakistan. Since 1947, the Indian government has awarded the title of field marshal to two generals.', 'The first was General Sam Manekshaw, who received the rank in 1973 for his leadership during the 1971 war with Pakistan that India won and that led to the creation of Bangladesh.', '“Manekshaw led their army in exemplary fashion and the Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, after the war, awarded him with the title of field marshal. Although he retired from the position of army chief in 1973, he retained the rank for the rest of his life, and attended official events in his uniform,” Rahiem said.', 'The second was Kodandera M Cariappa, India’s first post-independence army chief. He was awarded the title in 1986, three decades after retiring.', 'Cariappa, who led Indian forces during the country’s first war with Pakistan in 1947, was previously in the British Indian Army, like Ayub Khan. In fact, Khan served under Cariappa in 1945 when they were both posted in Waziristan, in present-day Pakistan.', 'Pakistan’s army is considered the most powerful institution in the country, wieldingdeep influenceacross nearly every sphere of society. It has ruled the country directly for more than three decades since independence in 1947.', 'The army chief is widely seen as the single most powerful position in Pakistan, often overshadowing the elected civilian government. The military has long faced allegations of manipulating election results to support favoured candidates.', 'Munir’s predecessor, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, acknowledged the military’s history ofpolitical interferencein his farewell speech in November 2022 but said that such meddling had ended.', 'But under Munir, the Pakistani military has been accused by leaders of former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf party of cracking down on the group’s leaders, including Khan. In Pakistan’s 2024 election, the PTI alleged widespread rigging, even as the party’s candidates – who ran as independents to get around a ban on the party’s participation – won more seats than any other party. Prime Minister Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) teamed up with the Pakistan People’s Party to form a government after fractured results.', 'Pakistan’s government rejected allegations of rigging, and the military under Munir has consistently rejected accusations of interference in the country’s civilian politics.', 'At the same time, the military has integrated itself into the country’s economic affairs, with Munir co-chairing the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) with premier Sharif, a high-level body created in 2023 to help investors bypass bureaucratic hurdles.', 'While Munir has been at the helm of the military, Pakistan’s economy – which was in a deep crisis in 2022 – has shown signs of recovery. Central bank data show foreign reserves hovering just over $10bn now, while inflation fell from more than 38 percent in May 2023 to just 0.3 percent in April 2025.', 'And while criticism from Khan and his supporters had dented the military’s popularity in recent years, the conflict with India has boosted the army’s stature, with polling showing asurge in its popularity.', 'The field marshal rank is largely ceremonial, say experts, and in itself doesn’t affect Munir’s leadership.', 'Munir, who has has previously led both military intelligence and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), the country’s premier intelligence agency, can continue as army chief until his tenure ends in November 2027. But alegislationpassed in October 2024 also allows for a second five-year term.', 'That second term is now increasingly likely, suggested\\xa0Maria Rashid, a lecturer at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London.', 'The promotion, she said, “almost certainly means that Asim Munir’s tenure will be granted an extension”.', 'Critics argue that the promotion ultimately boils down to the political calculations of the government and the military.', 'Political analyst Cyril Almeida suggested that amid themilitary’s dominanceover the political landscape, the promotion was in essence PM Sharif’s way of trying to ensure his own political survival by staying on good terms with Munir.', '“It is also about making it clear that he [Sharif] is not, and will never be a threat, so a replacement need not be considered,” Almeida told Al Jazeera.', 'Sharif first assumed office in April 2022, after former Prime Minister Imran Khan was ousted in a no-confidence vote, a move Khan blamed on a conspiracy involving the army, the United States, and his political opponents, though both the military and the US denied the claim.', 'A retired two-star general, speaking anonymously, warned that Munir’s promotion may further consolidate the military’s grip on the country’s affairs.', 'Washington-based security analyst Sahar Khan agreed. A further strengthening of the military’s influence in Pakistan’s politics would be “damaging to Pakistan’s already damaged democratic credentials,” she said.', 'But Chaudhry, the minister, rejected the criticism that the promotion would further entrench the military’s control of state and politics.', '“People often politicise everything and use it for their own purposes. We fought a war, and we won it,” he said, referring to the four-day conflict with India. “Those who are questioning military’s competence and suggest the army is busy oppressing our own citizens, this is the response to them.', '“The military, under Munir’s command, has shown how capable they are and how good they are at their job.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

Close to the end of Biden’s term in office, US officials renewed the status for these individuals until October 2026.', 'Economic and political turmoil have driven about eight million Venezuelans out of their country since 2014, according to the United Nations. The economic crisis was partly worsened by US sanctions against the government of PresidentNicolas Maduro.', 'There are about 600,000 Venezuelans in the US with TPS. Shortly after Trump took office in February, Noem revoked TPS for 348,202, who were granted TPS in 2021.', 'Noem justified the revocations due to gang membership and “adverse effects on US workers”.

This means that Noem will decide by July whether to revoke their status.', 'Noem also revoked TPS granted to 521,000 Haitians,14,600 Afghans and 7,900 Cameroonians. Cameroonians will lose protections in June, Afghans in July and Haitians in August.

Both of these aspects are common when it comes to emergency appeals.', 'The court has a 6-3 conservative majority.

United Nations officials and humanitarian groups say it will not have the ability to deal with the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza as a result of Israel’s two-month-long blockade.', 'Instead, the aid groups that have been working in Gaza point out that they have the capacity to bring in food and other humanitarian supplies – if only Israel would let them.', 'So what is the GHF, and why is the situation in Gaza so desperate? Here’s everything you need to know:', 'Officially independent, the GHF is an Israeli- and US-backed body that plans to distribute aid in the Gaza Strip.', 'One in five people in Gaza currentlyface starvationdue to the Israeli blockade of food and aid while 93 percent are experiencing acute food shortages, according to a UN-backed assessment released last week.', 'Under increasing international pressure to allow in aid, Israel has sought to find a solution that it says prevents aid from falling into the hands of the Palestinian group Hamas.

The GHF, on the other hand, is seen by critics as a way of politicising aid and not having the experience or capacity to bring aid to more than two million people.', 'The GHF “restricts aid to only one part of Gaza while leaving other dire needs unmet”, UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said at the Security Council last week. “It makes aid conditional on political and military aims.

But it was designed by Ukrainian and British aviation experts to work under combat conditions as well.', '“It’s being taken very seriously into consideration by the UK, France,” said Victoria Vdovychenko, an expert on hybrid warfare at Cambridge University’s Centre for Geopolitics, who has sat at some of the meetings. “German colleagues and Italian colleagues also do know about that, as well as the Scandinavian colleagues,” she said.', 'When it comes to implementing Skyshield in wartime conditions, she admits, “some of the partners are still fluctuating in their decision making”.', 'Skyshield was published in February and is the brainchild of Price of Freedom, a Ukrainian think tank founded by Lesya Orobets. She came up with the idea during an air defence crisis last spring, when Republican lawmakers in the US delayed the passage of a $60bn bill to send more aid to Ukraine.', 'During a phone call with the head of Ukraine’s air force, Orobets was told, “We are in the middle of a missile crisis. We don’t have enough [interceptors] to shoot down the missiles.”', 'Skyshield calls for the deployment of 120 European aircraft to protect Ukrainian civilian infrastructure and export corridors along the Danube River and the Black Sea, freeing up the Ukrainian Air Force to focus on the first line of defence in the contested east of the country.', '“There would be a piece of land of 200 kilometres [125 miles] between them at least,” said Orobets.', 'European jets would be based in neighbouring Poland and Romania, and fly mostly west of the Dnipro, protecting Kyiv on both sides of the river in the north of the country.', 'Western commanders are wary of costs, casualties and military implications.', 'Hourly flight costs, which include training, parts and maintenance, range from $28,000 for an F-16 to about $45,000 for a fourth-generation Rafale jet, Colonel Konstantinos Zikidis of the Hellenic Air Force told Al Jazeera.', '“We’d have to pay for people to be there, several shifts a day in all specialities … it will be exhausting,” he said, referring to aircraft technicians and pilots.', '“On the other hand, the proposal downplays the effectiveness of air defence systems, which are very effective against cruise missiles and have a far lower hourly operating cost than aircraft,” Zikidis said.', '“It’s also not really the job of aircraft to hunt down cruise missiles. They can do it if they are given coordinates by air command. They can’t go out on flight patrol and spot them by chance. So you need a very thick radar array to cover a given area, especially at low altitude.”', 'European NATO members do not operate AWACS airborne radar, which would be the ideal tool for the job according to Zikidis, but Ukrainian pilots have already downed Russian cruise missiles using air-to-air missiles, suggesting the ground-based radar assets are there.', 'Europe has provided Ukraine with Patriot and Samp-T long-range air defence systems and Iris-T medium-range systems, but these are enough only to protect larger urban centres, said Vdovychenko. Russia is also stepping up its attacks. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on May 4 that Russia had launched almost 1,200 long-range kamikaze drones and 10 missiles in just a week.', 'These types of weapons are routinely directed at civilian and industrial infrastructure, not the front lines, and Russian President Vladimir Putin is increasing production. Last year, Russia’s factory at Alabuga produced 6,000 Shahed/Geran long-range drones, said Ukraine’s head of the Center for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, last month. He said Putin set production at 8,000-10,000 drones this year.', 'The effects are visible. High-profile attacks on Kryvyi Rih, Kharkiv and Kyiv have killed dozens of people this year.', 'The second problem European air forces would face is that of casualties.', '“If one European plane falls and a pilot is killed, it will be very difficult for a European government to explain it,” said Zikidis. “For a Greek pilot to go and get killed in Ukraine could bring the government down,” he added.', '“I don’t think that there is a political will [for that], and that is what stops this partially,” said Vdovychenko.', 'But Orobets put this risk in a wider context.', '“We’re talking about catching cruise missiles and putting down the offensive drones, which is quite an easy target for trained pilots,” she told Al Jazeera. “So we do consider Skyshield to be less risky [than enforcing a no-fly zone] or any participation of the European troops closer to the front line.”', 'Thirdly, there are the military implications. Skyshield is partly about freeing up the Ukrainian Air Force to strike deeper inside Russia, deploying the estimated 85 F-16s it is being given.', 'That is because Russia has this year intensified its use of controlled air bombs (CABs), which are directed against front lines, reportedly\\xa0dropping 5,000 in April versus 4,800 in March, 3,370 in February and 1,830 in January.', 'Ukraine would target the airfields from which Russian jets take off to drop the CABs. It would also move missile launch systems closer to the front lines, increasing their reach inside Russia.', 'CABs are Russia’s most effective weapon at the front, and it has successfully leveraged its nuclear arsenal to intimidate NATO into allowing them to be flown in.', 'The Biden administration had refused to allow Ukraine to deploy Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMSs), which have a range of 300km (190 miles), because Russia considered their use dependent on US intelligence, in its view, making the US a cobelligerent in the war.', 'It has expressed exactly the same view of Germany sending its 500km (310-mile) range Taurus missile to Ukraine.', 'In the same vein, Russia has threatened to act against any European force deployment to Ukraine.', 'Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu last month told a summit of the foreign ministers of the BRICS group of states in Rio de Janeiro that “military units of Western states on Ukrainian territory … will be considered as legitimate targets”.', 'These threats have been effective. The Biden administration was against the idea of allowing the Polish and Romanian air forces to shoot down drones and missiles in Ukrainian airspace that were headed into Polish and Romanian airspace, Orobets said.', 'The Biden administration “thought that if any American pilot on any American jet or any Western jet would enter the Ukrainian airspace, then America or another country would become cobelligerent”, she said.', 'The same applied to the notion of Europeans entering Ukraine’s airspace.', '“They were scared that Russians would then escalate to the level of a conflict they could not sustain.

It is highly likely he was carrying a diagnosis of prostate cancer throughout his White House tenure and the American people were uninformed.”', 'Howard P Forman, a professor of radiology at Yale University, said it was “inconceivable” that Biden’s cancer was not detected before he left office, as it would have been picked up by a blood test known as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test.', '“Gleason grade 9 would have had an elevated PSA level for some time before this diagnosis. And he must have had a PSA test numerous times before. This is odd,” Forman said in a post on X.', 'However, Peter Nelson, an oncologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, said it is possible for prostate cancer to develop and spread rapidly in a short period of time, though it is more common for it to remain localised without detection for years before progressing to other parts of the body.', '“It is possible for prostate cancer to develop and then spread in a very short time span – by short, within one to two years,” Nelson told Al Jazeera.', '“So, yes, it is credible that a man of his age and position could have his cancer develop and progress without detection. This would not be common, but definitely happens,” Nelson said.', 'Daniel W Lin, a prostate cancer expert at UW Medicine in Washington state, said that while Biden has “very likely” had cancer for years, it is possible he was not given a PSA test.', '“There are screening controversies with the use of PSA, and many medical groups do not recommend PSA testing after 70 or 75 years of age, although others recommend based on life expectancy or state of health rather than age cut-points,” Lin told Al Jazeera.', 'Lin said it was also possible that Biden has a rarer form of cancer that is not detectable by the test.', '“This situation is less common, but not considered overly rare. Additionally, when this situation occurs, it is more common in high-grade cancers, such as former President Biden’s case,” he said.', '“Playing the odds, he does not fall into this category, however, it can definitely occur.”', 'Peter Black, director of the Vancouver Prostate Centre in Canada, said Biden’s cancer going undetected in tests would be his best guess for the apparently sudden diagnosis.', '“My best guess is that he has had a PSA done every year for a long time because that is what you would expect for a US senator/vice president/president, and that he actually has an age-appropriate PSA that did not raise any alarms,” Black told Al Jazeera.', '“A diagnosis of metastatic prostate cancer is usually associated with a very high PSA, but in a small minority of patients, the PSA is actually normal,” he said.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

Either they cut off all the support to Ukraine and force elections, or they continue supporting Ukraine in order for Ukraine to be able to settle it on the battlefield with the Russians,” Miron said, adding that the second option is very difficult, given other priorities that the Trump administration has. Trump had advocated for scaling back US military aid to Ukraine.', 'On Sunday, Russia launched its largest drone attack since the beginning of the war, Ukraine said, killing at least one woman.

The nets billowed open and sunk quickly under the weight of metal chains.', 'From where they stood on the riverbank, they started to pull in their nets, already filled with dozens of squirming black-bodied catfish.', '“You don’t see any other fish. Only these,” said Mohamad Haziq A Rahman, the leader of Malaysia’s “foreign fish hunter squad”, as they emptied their catch of wriggling suckermouth catfish into piles, away from the river.', 'None of the fish caught that morning were sold at nearby markets or food stalls. The sole purpose of the expedition was to cull suckermouth catfish, one among a growing number of invasive species that have in recent decades dominated freshwater habitats across Southeast Asia.', 'Once brought in for commercial or hobbyist reasons, invasive fish are not only threatening to edge native species out of the food chain in Malaysia and elsewhere, but they also spread diseases and cause great damage to local environments.', 'Invasive fish are a problem the world over, but experts say the issue is keenly felt in mega-biodiverse Malaysia.', '“More than 80 percent of rivers in the Klang Valley have been invaded by foreign fish species, which can cause the extinction of the rivers’ indigenous aquatic life,” said Dr Kalithasan Kailasam, a river expert with the Malaysia-based Global Environment Centre.', '“It’s growing in almost all other main rivers in Malaysia,” said Kailasam, explaining how species such as the suckermouth have the potential to quickly reproduce and survive in dirty water, leaving local fish on the losing side.', 'Aside from the suckermouth, Malaysia’s waterways are now threatened by species such as the aggressive peacock bass, Javanese carp and redtail catfish, he said.', 'While the full extent of the problem is not yet known, Malaysia’s fisheries department, after a four-year study until 2024, found invasive species in 39 areas across nearly every state in peninsular Malaysia and on the island of Labuan, including in dams, lakes and major rivers.', 'Alarmed by the threat, a small group of citizens banded together to fight the aquatic invaders.', 'Led by Haziq, they are working to reclaim Malaysia’s rivers one fin at a time.', 'The citizen fish hunters’ quest to fight invasive species started during the country’s COVID-19 lockdowns, when Haziq, a former healthcare consultant, turned to fishing as a pastime in a river near his house in central Selangor state. He found every fish he caught was of the suckermouth variety, also known as the “pleco” or “ikan bandaraya” – which translates as the “janitor fish” in Malay and is favoured by hobbyists to keep aquariums clean, as the suckermouth feeds on algae, leftover food and dead fish.', 'Native to South America, varieties of the suckermouth have also been introduced into waterways in the United States, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, often when owners dump them into rivers, canals, dams or free them after they grow too large for their aquarium tanks.', 'Because of their thick, scaly skin, suckermouths are usually avoided by even larger predators in Malaysia, and can grow to about half a metre (1.6ft) in length.', 'As bottom feeders, the catfish have been known to eat the eggs of other species and destroy their nesting sites. Catfish also burrow into riverbanks to nest, causing them to erode and collapse, which is a serious environmental issue in flood-prone Malaysia where year-end monsoon winds bring heavy rain.', 'Malaysia’s central bank said in 2024 that floods are the cause of 85 percent of the country’s natural disasters, with their frequency increasing since 2020.\\xad', 'Though far from his favourite fish to catch, Haziq discovered that suckerfish roe could be used as bait for other bigger fish, and he earned some money selling their eggs to other fishing enthusiasts. He also gained a following by putting his exploits on social media. Further research then led him to learn about the threats posed by invasive species.', 'Haziq started to attract like-minded anglers, and, in 2022, they decided to form a group for hunting suckermouth, meeting nearly every week in a river to carry out a cull.', 'Their public profile and popularity are growing. The group’s membership has now grown to more than 1,000, and it has a strong fan following on social media.', '“People kept asking how to join our group, because we were looking at the ecosystem,” Haziq said.', 'Focusing first on Malaysia’s Selangor state and rivers in the capital Kuala Lumpur, the fish hunter squad had netted nearly 31 tonnes of suckermouths by 2024. They have also visited rivers in other states in Malaysia as their campaign expands.', 'During a hunt in the Klang River earlier this year, Haziq and his comrades deployed to the river’s banks on a mission to see how many suckermouth they could catch during a single outing.', 'But hunting for invasive fish can be tricky. Without boats, the hunters have to wade into the fast-moving polluted waters from muddy banks, while navigating underwater debris such as rubbish on the riverbed.', 'Almost all the fish they caught were of the invasive kind, but once in a while, they do net a local.', '“Haruan (snakehead)!” shouted ex-navy diver Syuhaily Hasibullah, 46, as he showed off a small fish half the size of his arm, taken from a net containing several suckermouths.', '“This one is rare! There used to be a lot of them in the river,” he told Al Jazeera.', 'Haziq said if the hunters found many invasive species in their nets, they would organise another outing to the same location, bringing along more people to take part.', 'The day they set out to calculate how many invasive fish they could catch in a single outing turned out to yield half a tonne of suckermouth in just three hours – so many they had to stuff them into sacks.', 'Previously, the hunters buried their hauls in deep holes away from the river. Now, they have found more creative ways to dispose of what is, generally, an unwanted fish.', 'At the event earlier this year, sacks of suckermouths were handed over to a local entrepreneur looking to experiment with turning the fish into a form of charcoal known as biochar.', 'Some local universities have also started researching the possible use of the suckermouth. One university research article explored the potential of suckermouth collagen for pharmaceutical use, while another considered its use as fertiliser or even as a type of leather.', 'On some occasions, the hunters even eat the fish they catch, though that depends on which river they have been taken from.', 'While redtail or African catfish are considered delicacies by some, the suckermouth, also known in India as “devil fish”, is a less attractive snacking option – but not out of the question when it comes to a quick riverside grill.', '“If the fish is from the Klang River, we don’t eat it,” Mohd Zulkifli Mokhtar told Al Jazeera, before dozens of hunters broke their fast during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan.', '“But if it’s from the Langat River, it’s still OK,” Zulkifli said, as dozens of suckermouth caught in the less polluted Langat River, located in Bangi some 25km (16 miles) south of Kuala Lumpur, were gutted, marinated in satay and grilled on skewers.', 'Studies from Bangladesh and Indonesia have found varieties of catfish with high levels of heavy metals and contaminants. A 2024 article by Malaysia’s Universiti Teknologi Mara cited a study that showed the level of contaminants in the suckermouth was “heavily influenced by the level of pollution in the river”.', 'While Malaysia’s fisheries department said there were no records of local species becoming endangered because of invasive ones, native fish nevertheless face threats.', 'Local fish either faced becoming prey or have had to fight to survive, with the department finding in a survey that 90 percent of the fish in six rivers in the Selangor and Kuala Lumpur region were now foreign arrivals.', 'The department’s Director-General Adnan Hussain said various measures had been put in place, including the release of some 33.6 million native fish and prawns into rivers nationwide from 2021 to 2025 to “balance the impact” of invasive fish.', 'Late last year, the state government of Selangor also came up with a scheme to pay anglers one Malaysian ringgit ($0.23) for every kilogramme (2.2lb) of the suckermouth fish removed from two rivers. The captured fish were to be turned into animal feed and organic fertiliser, an official said.', 'Restrictions on the import of certain foreign aquatic species – including entire species and groups – into Malaysia were also imposed last year, and the fisheries department said that programmes and collaboration with the fish hunters had also helped to deal with the problem.', 'In one river in Selangor state, Adnan said the amount of invasive fish caught following one eradication programme had dropped from 600kg (1,300lb) in a May 2024 event to just more than 150kg (330lb) four or five months later.', 'However, Universiti Malaysia Terengganu fish researcher Professor Amirrudin Ahmad said it was “almost impossible” to fully exterminate the country’s invasive fish.', '“So many species live in (native water bodies) and getting rid of invasive species by the means of poisoning the water is not feasible at all,” he said, adding there were close to 80 recorded fish species introduced in Malaysia so far.', 'He further warned that rising temperatures caused by climate change may even allow species like the predatory Mekong redtail catfish to proliferate in cooler upstream waters in Malaysia.', '“They are here to stay,” Amirrudin said.', '“It is simply,” he said, “that the environment is mostly similar to their native country, or these species are highly adaptable.”', 'That this is an ecological war that can never truly be won is a point that Haziq and his fellow fish hunters are fully aware of. Nearly every river they visited in recent times had almost nothing but invasive fish, he said.', 'But their mission will carry on, he added, along with the hunting and public awareness that has spurred thousands to follow his social media videos on the subject.', '“Yes, this fish won’t be completely gone from our rivers,” he told Al Jazeera.', '“But if we don’t act now, it would be worse,” he said.', '“It’s better to take action than to just leave it alone,” he added.', '“At least we can reduce the population, than allow it to completely take over our local fish.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

It has further sought to paint undocumented migration into the US as an “invasion” and link Tren de Aragua’s activities in the US to the Venezuelan government, an assertion that a recently declassified intelligence memo disputes.', 'That, the Trump administration has argued, justifies its use of the Alien Enemies Act, which has only been used three times prior in US history – and only during periods of war.', 'But Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act has spurred a legal backlash, with several US district courts hearing petitions from migrants fearing expulsion under the law.', 'Multiple judgeshave barredthe law’s use for expedited removals. But one judge in Pennsylvania ruled the Trump administration could deploy the law – provided it offer appropriate notice to those facing deportation. She suggested 21 days.', 'The Supreme Court on Friday did not weigh in on whether Trump’s use of the law was merited. Instead, its ruling – 24 pages in total, including a dissent – hewed closely to the issue of whether the Venezuelans in question deserved relief from their imminent deportation under the law.', 'The majority of the nine-justice bench noted that “evidence” it had seen in the case suggested “the Government had in fact taken steps on the afternoon of April 18” to invoke the Alien Enemies Act, even transporting the migrants “from their detention facility to an airport and later returning them”.', 'The justices asserted that they had a right to weigh in on the case, in order to prevent “irreparable harm” to the migrants and assert their jurisdiction in the case. Otherwise, they pointed out a deportation could put the migrants beyond their reach.', 'Justice Brett Kavanaugh went a step further in a separate opinion, calling on the Supreme Court to issue a final and binding ruling in the matter, rather than simply grant this one petition.', '“The circumstances call for a prompt and final resolution, which likely can be provided only by this Court,” he said, agreeing with the majority’s decision.', 'Thomas and Alito, in their dissent, argued the Supreme Court had not afforded enough time to a lower court to rule on the emergency petition.', 'In the aftermath of the ruling, Trump lashed out on Truth Social, portraying the Supreme Court’s majority as overly lax towards migrants.', '“THE SUPREME COURT WON’T ALLOW US TO GET CRIMINALS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY!” Trumpwrotein the first of two consecutive posts.', 'In the second, he called Friday’s decision the mark of a “bad and dangerous day in America”. He complained that affirming the right to due process would result in “a long, protracted, and expensive Legal Process, one that will take, possibly, many years for each person”.', 'He also argued that the high court was preventing him from exercising his executive authority.', '“The Supreme Court of the United States is not allowing me to do what I was elected to do,” hewrote, imagining a circumstance where extended deportation hearings would lead to “bedlam” in the US.', 'His administration has long accused the courts of interference in his agenda. But critics have warned that Trump’s actions – particularly, alleged efforts to ignore court orders – are eroding the US’s constitutional system of checks and balances.', 'In a statement after the ruling, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) praised the court’s decision as a bulwark against human rights abuses.', '“The court’s decision to stay removals is a powerful rebuke to the government’s attempt to hurry people away to aGulag-type prison in El Salvador,” said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project.', '“The use of a wartime authority during peacetime, without even affording due process, raises issues of profound importance.”', 'The Supreme Court currently boasts a conservative supermajority, with six right-leaning judges and three left-leaning ones.', 'Three among them were appointed by Trump himself.

But she said the shift under the Trump administration forced her to abandon her ambassadorship to Ukraine, a position she held from 2022 until last month.', '“I cannot stand by while a country is invaded, a democracy bombarded, and children killed with impunity,” she said of the situation in Ukraine.', '“I believe that the only way to secure U.S. interests is to stand up for democracies and to stand against autocrats. Peace at any price is not peace at all ― it is appeasement.”', 'Brink’s position as ambassador has spanned much of the current conflict in Ukraine. After annexing Crimea and occupying other Ukrainian territories starting in 2014, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022. Brink assumed her post that May.', 'But the slow-grinding war in Ukraine has cost thousands of lives and displaced many more. While campaigning for re-election in 2024, Trump blamed the war’s eruption on the “weak” foreign policy of his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden.', 'He also pledged to end the war on his first day back in office, if re-elected. “I’ll have that done in 24 hours. I’ll have it done,” Trump told one CNN town hall in 2023.', 'Since taking office, however, Trump has walked back those comments, calling them an “exaggeration” in an interview with Time Magazine.', 'Still, his administration has pushed Ukraine and Russia to engage in peace talks, as part of an effort to end the war. How those negotiations have unfolded under Trump, however, has been the source of scrutiny and debate.', 'Ukraine and its European allies have accused Trump of sidelining their interests in favour of his one-on-one negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. They also have criticised Trump and his officials for seeming to offer Russia concessions even before the negotiations officially began.', 'On February 12, for instance, his Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told an international defence group in Brussels that Ukraine may never regain some of its occupied territory.', '“We must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,” he said, adding that membership in the NATO military alliance was also unlikely. “Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering.”', 'Trump has gone so far as toblame Ukraine’s NATO ambitionsas the cause of the war, something critics blast as a Kremlin talking point.', 'Amid the negotiations, the relationship between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has grown increasingly testy. Already, during his first term, Trump faced impeachment proceedings over an alleged attempt to pressure Zelenskyy by withholding military aid.', 'During his second term, though, Trump upped the ante, calling the Ukrainian president a “dictator” for not holding elections, something prohibited under Ukraine’s wartime laws.', 'Onepublic displayof frustration came in the White House on February 28, when Trump shouted at Zelenskyy,calling him “disrespectful”during a gathering with journalists.', 'The US president also used the appearance to defend his warm relationship with Russia’s president. “\\u200aPutin went through a hell of a lot with me,” Trump told Zelenskyy.', 'The shouting match led to a brief suspension of US aid andintelligence sharingwith Ukraine.', 'In the months since, their two countries have agreed to a deal that would establish a joint investment fund that would allow Washington access to Ukraine’s mineral resources — a long-desired Trump goal.', 'The US president has voiced concern about the amount of money invested in Ukraine’s security, with Congress appropriating more than $174bn since the war began in 2022. He has also argued that a US mining presence would help deter foreign attacks in Ukraine.', 'But peace between Russia and Ukraine has remained elusive.

The word “historic” was used more than a few times by US officials to describe the visits.', 'With Trump returning to the White House, here are five key takeaways from his trip:', 'Addressing an investment summit in Riyadh, Trump promoted a realist approach to the Middle East — one in which the US does not intervene in the affairs of other countries.', 'He took a swipe at neoconservatives who oversaw the USwars in Iraqand Afghanistan, as he lauded Gulf leaders for developing the region.', '“This great transformation has not come from Western intervention or flying people in beautiful planes, giving you lectures on how to live and how to govern your own affairs,” he said.', '“The gleaming marbles of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were not created by the so-called nation-builders, neo-cons or liberal nonprofits like those who spent trillions and trillions of dollars failing todevelop Kabul, Baghdad, so many other cities.”', 'Trump built his political brand with his “America First” slogan, calling for the US to focus on its own issues instead of helping — or bombing — foreign countries.', 'But his words at the investment summit marked a stern rebuke of the neo-cons who dominated Trump’s Republican Party a decade ago.', '“In the end, the so-called nation-builders wrecked far more nations than they built, and the interventionists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves,” Trump said.', 'It is rare for US presidents to travel to the Middle East and not visit Israel, but Trump omitted the US ally from his itinerary as he toured the region.', 'Skipping Israel was seen as a reflection of the deteriorating ties between the US administration and the government of Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahu.', 'This week’s trip also came in the context of several moves perceived as evidence of the US marginalising Israel. The US has continued to hold talks with Israel’s rival Iran, announced a ceasefire with the Houthis in Yemen, and conducted unilateral negotiations to release Israeli soldierEdan Alexander, a US citizen, from Hamas captivity.', 'Moreover, while touring the Gulf, Trumpdid not use his remarks to prioritisethe establishment of formal diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel, which had been a top goal during his first term.', 'It remains unclear how Trump’s decisions will affect the “special relationship” between the two allies, but experts say it is becoming increasingly apparent that the US no longer views the Middle East solely through the lens of Israel.', '“Is it a tactical problem for Netanyahu and the entire pro-Israel lobby? I think it is,” Khaled Elgindy, a visiting scholar at Georgetown University, said of Trump’s shift.', '“It does throw a wrench in the machinery because it is a president who is showing openly daylight with Israeli decision-making, and not just in rhetoric, but acting on it — leaving Israel out of the process.”', 'With that chasm emerging, some Palestinian rights advocates had hoped that the US president’s trip to the region would see Washington pursue a deal to end Israel’s war on Gaza.', 'But as Trump marvelled at the luxurious buildings in the Gulf, Israel intensifiedits bombardmentto destroy what’s left of the Palestinian territory.', 'No ceasefire was announced, despite reports of continuing talks in Doha. And Israel appears to be pushing forward with its plan to expand its assault on Gaza as itcontinues to block aidfor the nearly two million people in the enclave, leading to fears of famine.', 'United Nations experts and rights groups have described the situationas a genocide.', 'But despite preaching “peace and prosperity” for both Israelis and Palestinians, Trump made no strong push to end the war during this week’s trip.', 'On Thursday, Trump suggested that he has not given up on the idea of depopulating Gaza and turning it over to the US — a proposal that legal experts say amounts to ethnic cleansing.', '“I have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good. Make it a freedom zone,” he said. “Let the United States get involved, and make it just a freedom zone.”', 'In a move that surprised many observers, Trump announced from Riyadh that he will offer sanction relief to Syria, as the country emerges from a decade-plus civil war.', 'Trump also met with interim Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa anddescribed himas a “young, attractive guy”.', 'A wholesale lifting of sanctions was not expected, in part because of Israel’s hostility to the new authorities in Syria. Israeli officials often describe al-Sharaa, who led al-Qaeda’s branch in Syria before severing ties with the group, as a “terrorist”.', 'But Trump said he made the decision to lift the economic penalties against Syria at the request of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.', '“I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,” the US president said.', 'The White House said on Wednesday that Trump had a list of requests for al-Sharaa, including establishing diplomatic relations with Israel and deporting “Palestinian terrorists”.', 'Removing US sanctions, which had been imposed on the government of former PresidentBashar al-Assad, is likely to be a boost for the new Syrian authorities, who are grappling with an ailing economy after years of conflict.', '“Lifting sanctions on Syria represents a fundamental turning point,” Ibrahim Nafi Qushji, an economist,told Al Jazeera.', '“The Syrian economy will transition from interacting with developing economies to integrating with more developed ones, potentially significantly reshaping trade and investment relations.”', 'In Saudi Arabia, Trump declared that he wants a deal with Iran — and he wants it done quickly.', '“We really want them to be a successful country,” the US president said of Iran.', '“We want them to be a wonderful, safe, great country, but they cannot have a nuclear weapon.

After being airlifted to a hospital, Rushdie eventually lost sight in one eye. Another speaker — Henry Reese, who runs a nonprofit for writers in exile — also received injuries, including a stab wound.', 'Rushdie, now 77,testifiedin the state-level trial against Matar. “He was hitting me repeatedly. Hitting and slashing,” the novelist said.', 'He added that he thought at first he was being struck by fists, not a knife. It was only later that he realised the severity of his situation: “I saw a large quantity of blood pouring onto my clothes.”', 'The injuries resulted in Rushdie undergoing painful surgeries, including to seal his blinded eye. He spent months in recovery. “I’m not as energetic as I used to be. I’m not as physically strong as I used to be,” he told the court.', 'On February 21, after less than two hours of deliberation, a jury in western New York found Matar bothguilty of attempted murderfor his attack on Rushdie and of assault for the injuries to Reese.', 'In Friday’s hearing, Matar received 25 years for the attempted murder sentence and seven for the assault on Reese, to be served at the same time since the attacks happened at the same time.', 'Rushdie, a British American novelist, was born in India to a Muslim family. His books have won wide acclaim: His novel Midnight’s Children earned the Booker Prize, a top literary honour awarded each year to a work of English-language fiction.', 'But it was his fourth novel, The Satanic Verses, in 1988 that stirred up lasting controversy, specifically for passages deemed blasphemous to Muslims. By 1989, Iran’s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had issued a fatwa calling for Rushdie’s death.', 'The announcement sent Rushdie into hiding, and the British government assigned him round-the-clock protection. Deadly protests accompanied the novel’s publication, and bookstores, along with those close to Rushdie, faced violent attacks.', 'Before Friday’s sentencing, Matar also delivered a statement to the court voicing his opposition to Rushdie and his work.', '“Salman Rushdie wants to disrespect other people,” said Matar. “He wants to be a bully, he wants to bully other people. I don’t agree with that.”', 'Later, outside the courtroom, defence lawyer Nathaniel Barone took questions about whether his client felt regret or remorse about his actions.', '“\\u200aI think that’s a fair question, and I can’t answer that,” he responded. “All I can tell you is that I think that, unfortunately, people make bad decisions, and it’s something that certainly they regret or they’re remorseful about, but they may have a difficult time expressing that for whatever reasons.”', 'Barone added that he felt Matar would have acted differently in hindsight. “\\u200aI know, if he had the opportunity, he would not be sitting where he is sitting today. And if he could change things, he would.”', 'Matar’s defence team had sought a lesser sentence of 12 years in prison and plans to appeal the verdict, arguing that the prosecution did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt an intent to kill Rushdie.', 'Barone also questioned the intense level of scrutiny on the case, calling it a “publicity sponge”. He argued that his client was denied the presumption of innocence due to any suspect.', 'The prosecution, however, praised the sentencing hearing’s outcome as justice for the pain Rushdie continues to endure.', '“He’s traumatised. He has nightmares about what he experienced,” Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt said after the hearing.', '“Obviously, this is a major setback for an individual that was starting to emerge in his very later years of life into society after going into hiding after the fatwa.”', 'In explaining to the judge why he was pushing for the maximum sentence, Schmidt said that Matar “designed this attack so that he could inflict the most amount of damage, not just upon Mr. Rushdie, but upon this community, upon the 1,400 people who were there to watch it”.', 'Separately, Matar, now 27, faces three counts of federal terrorism-related charges in the US, including providing material support to terrorists and committing terrorism that transcends national boundaries.', '“We allege that, in attempting to murder Salman Rushdie in New York in 2022, Hadi Matar committed an act of terrorism in the name of Hezbollah, a designated terrorist organization aligned with the Iranian regime,” former US Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. Iran, however, has denied involvement in Matar’s attack on Rushdie.', 'Rushdie, meanwhile, has channelled his experiences from the attack into a memoir called Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

But both countriesstill sent delegations– agreeing to a prisoner swap – and the meeting in Istanbul on Friday was the first direct talks since shortly after the war began in February 2022.', 'Some of those talks in 2022 were also hosted by Turkiye, highlighting the central role the country has played in the search for a resolution to one of the world’s most significant geopolitical conflicts.', 'Turkiye is also poised to expand its influence in Syria, where theUS has lifted sanctionson the Turkish-allied government, and has a significant win on the domestic front, after the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) announced this weekthat it was disbanding, ending a 40-year war against the Turkish state.', 'A direct meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy on Turkish soil would have capped off a strong week for Turkiye, but analysts say that its central role to the process is a victory nonetheless.', '“Turkiye stands to win diplomatically whichever way the talks go,” Ziya Meral of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) said, even if the analyst ultimately was sceptical of any peace framework emerging from the talks. “It fulfils Ankara’s desire to be a negotiator and key player in regional developments. The fact that Ankara is in a position to engage both with the United States and Russia, as well as Ukraine is indeed a diplomatic success.”', 'Over the last 15 years or so, Turkiye has established itself as a significant diplomatic player, extending its influence across Africa and playing a pivotal role in the overthrow of long-term Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, all while maintaining an intensely delicate balancing act between belligerents in the Russia-Ukraine war.', '“There are many reasons why Turkiye is hosting the talks,” Omer Ozkizilcik, a non-resident fellow at The Atlantic Council, told Al Jazeera.', '“Turkiye started a peace process independent of the US shortly after the invasion, leading to the Istanbul protocols of 2022. This is also a new model of negotiation, pioneered by Turkiye,” he said, referring to the draft peace agreement brokered between the two states thatRussia has since accusedUkraine and the West of walking away from.', '“Before, neutral states such as Switzerland with no stake in the conflict would mediate. Now, under a new model, Turkiye is successfully negotiating in conflicts where it does have diplomatic, economic and geopolitical stakes,” Ozkizilcik added, listing a number of disputes where Turkiye had played a mediating role, such as that between Ethiopia and Somalia, where Turkiye was able to negotiate in December a “historic reconciliation” in President Recep Tayyip Erodgan’s words.', 'Turkiye has its own interests across these countries, including its supply of drones to Ukraine and a significant military presence in Somalia. However, it is still able to present itself as a reliable arbitrator in peace talks involving these countries.', '“It’s a new Turkish model that is seeing the country emerge as a regional diplomatic power,” Ozkizilcik said.', 'The balancing act Turkiye has followed in negotiating between Russia and Ukraine hasn’t been easy – particularly when Ankara has had to take into account its opposition to Russian expansionism in the Black Sea region and Moscow’s support for parties opposed to Ankara in the Middle East and North Africa.', 'Turkiye labelled Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a “war” early in the conflict, allowing it to implement the1936 Montreux Convention– effectively confining Russia’s military vessels to the Black Sea.', 'Ankara and Moscow have also found themselves on opposing sides in Libya and Syria. In Libya, Turkiye backs the United Nations-recognised government, in contrast to Russia’s support for armed forces in the insurgent east, while in Syria, Turkiye supported the ultimately victorious opposition forces against the Russian-backed al-Assad regime.', 'Syria was the source of the biggest tension between the two when, in 2015, Turkiyeshot down a Russian fighter jetnear the Turkiye-Syria border. The incident triggered a severe deterioration in diplomatic and economic ties, but a Turkish statement of regret led to a rapprochement the next year, and relations have remained strong.', 'Those strong ties have also survived Turkiye’s supply of drones and other military equipment to Ukraine throughout the course of the war.', 'Russia has seemingly turned a blind eye to that, and maintains “economic, diplomatic and energy relations” with Turkiye, Ozkizilcik said.', 'The benefits of good relations with Turkiye seem to outweigh Russia’s unhappiness with some aspects of Turkish policy, and Turkiye’s position as a member of NATO that Russia can still deal with is in itself useful.', 'In 2022, Turkiye was prominent in opposing Western sanctions on Russia; describing them as a “provocation“. And Turkiye has rarely been content to toe the NATO line,for a time opposing Sweden and Finland’sentry into the alliance, and also agreeing on a deal to buyRussia’s S-400 missile system in 2017.', 'Turkiye’s purchase of the missile system led toUS sanctions, exclusion from the F-35 defence programme and accusations in some quarters that Ankara was “turning its back” on the West as part of a pivot towards Russia.', '“Both sides have learned to compartmentalise differences,” Ozkizilcik said. He referred to an attack in 2020 that killed more than 33 Turkish soldiers in Syria by regime forces acting in coordination with Russia. “There were talks, both sides met and addressed the issue and they moved on. More recently, when Turkish-backed forces overthrew the Assad regime, Erdogan still called Putin on his birthday and congratulated him.”', 'But Turkiye has been able to strengthen its relationship with the West in the years since, demonstrating its usefulness, particularly when it came to Ukraine.', 'Turkiye was instrumental in brokering a deal in 2022 to allow Ukraine to export its grain by sea, and has also been firm in its stance that Russian-occupied Crimea – the homeland of the Turkic Muslim Crimean Tatars – be returned to Ukraine.', 'Steven Horrell, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, believes that Ukraine “appreciates Turkiye’s past support to them”, even if it has some qualms about its ties with Russia.', 'Zelenskyy has repeatedly thanked Erdogan for his role in facilitating talks and in supporting Ukraine. On Thursday, the Ukrainian leader highlighted Turkiye’s support for Ukraine, and even said that his country’s participation in direct talks – despite Putin’s absence – was “out of respect” for Erdogan and US President Donald Trump.', 'Earlier in the week, Zelenskyy had thanked Erdogan for his support “and readiness to facilitate diplomacy at the highest level”.', 'I spoke with the President of Türkiye@RTErdoganto discuss key details of the meeting in Türkiye, which could help bring an end to the war.

But\\xa0New Delhi is looking to clinch a trade deal with the US within the90-day pauseannounced by Trump on April 9, on so called reciprocal tariffs for major trading partners. On May 8, the White House secured atrade agreement with the United Kingdom, two days after India inked a similar pact with it.', 'India’s equity benchmarks jumped about 1.5 percent following Trump’s comments.

India ran a $45.7bn surplus with the US last year, mainly in the form of pharmaceutical products, electrical machinery and jewellery.', 'Having long complained that India’s tariffs were too high and hurt US businesses, Trump pledged to impose “reciprocal” tariffs of 27 percent on India. Those tariffs are currently on hold until early July.', 'A 10 percent base tariff continues to apply to India and many other nations during the pause.', 'India’s average tariff rate is 17 percent, compared with 3.3 percent by the US, as per a report by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.', 'In recent weeks, India has made overtures to placate Trump’s public disapproval, including lowering import duties on US goods like bourbon whiskey – down from 150 to 100 percent – and Harley-Davidson motorcycles – from 50 to 40 percent.', 'As part of ongoing trade talks, New Delhi has also proposed zero tariffs on car parts, on a reciprocal basis and up to a certain amount, Bloomberg reported earlier this month.', 'A delegation of Indian officials is set to visit the US later this month to try and move talks forward. The Reuters news agency reported that India’s trade minister, Piyush Goyal, might visit too.', 'Trump’s recent comments come days after India threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs linked to higher US duties on steel and aluminium, a sign that New Delhi is adopting a\\xa0more bullish approach\\xa0in its negotiations with Washington.', 'For now, though, trade talks are thought to be progressing well.', 'Reuters reported that New Delhi has\\xa0offered\\xa0to\\xa0reduce duties to zero on 60 percent of US imports in a first phase deal, while also offering preferential access to nearly 90 percent of the merchandise India imports from the US.', 'In theory, this would bring the average tariff differential (the variation in tariff rates countries impose on each other) between India and the US down by 9 percentage points, significantly lowering trade barriers in the world’s fifth-largest economy.', 'Preferential market access – or lower import entry requirements into the US compared with other countries India trades with – is being considered for key goods such as jewellery, textiles and agricultural products like bananas and grapes.', '“Preferential market access for India would mean better terms of trade for these goods compared to America’s other trading partners,” an Indian government official who preferred not to be named told Reuters.', 'To make the deal more attractive for Washington, India has also offered to ease export regulations on several high-value US imports, the first official said. These include aircraft, electric vehicles, medical devices, and hydrocarbons.', 'Beyond tariffs, India has also asked the US to treat it on par with other top US allies such as the UK and Japan in terms of access to critical technology sectors like artificial intelligence, biotech, and semiconductors.', 'India’s expectation of being exempt from tariffs is at odds with the deal struck between the US and UK, in which only certain goods, based on mutual interest, had tariffs removed – as opposed to across-the-board withdrawals.', 'Elsewhere, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week hinted that Washington might be looking to secure “purchase agreements” for specific products with China, as part ofongoing trade negotiations with Beijing.', 'As such, recent trade deals suggest that Trump’s tariff strategy amounts to carve-outs on particular goods, as opposed to broad free trade agreements. Looking ahead, comments from Indian and US officials hint at a similar arrangement.', 'Domestic issues also stand in the way of a free trade deal. India has long used tariffs to shield agricultural markets from cheap imports. Farmers have expressed fears that Modi would weaken those protections as part of a deal with Trump.', 'Then, at the geopolitical level too, India is in a tricky position. \\xa0While Washington sees New Delhi as a counterbalance to Beijing’s growing clout, India imported $113.45bn from China last year. By contrast, it imported just $40bn from the US.', 'What’s more, China recently warned the UK over its trade deal with the US. It accused the UK of aligning with the US in a move that could compel British companies to exclude Chinese products from their supply chains.', 'China haswarnedit is ready to hurt countries that fall in line with the US in order to pressure Beijing.', 'For its part, India has recently shown willingness to engage in trade deals after years of scepticism.

The slang was highly in use in restaurants back in the 1930s, and usually signalled to waiters and customers that an item on a menu was sold out and could not be provided.', 'The “47”, they claim, refers to Trump’s current term in office as the 47th president of the US.', 'Comey, on the same day, took the photo down. In a separate Instagram post, the former intelligence boss explained that he took the photo while “on a beach walk, which I assumed were a political message”.', '“I didn’t realise some folks associate those numbers with violence. It never occurred to me, but I oppose violence of any kind, so I took the post down,” he said.', 'The hashtag #8647 has previously, and as early as March, appeared on social media sites like TikTok among posters criticising Trump and calling for his removal.

Gabbard said Comey “should be held accountable and put behind bars for this”.', 'Republican Congressman Andy Ogles said he sent a letter to US intelligence agencies calling for an investigation into Comey’s “disturbing” post to see if the former intelligence boss had violated two federal laws – threatening the president and interstate sharing of threatening communication.', 'Ogles also demanded confirmation on whether Comey still has access to classified material because of his previous role as FBI director.', '“If Comey broke the law, he shouldn’t get a pass.

The administration’s official reason for firing him was that Comey was “ineffective”, referring to dissatisfaction with the Clinton investigation, which eventually ended without the politician being charged.', 'The major sticking point between Trump and Comey, according to analysts, was Comey’s focus on the Russia issue and his refusal to state in public that Trump and his Trump Organisation were not personally being investigated.', 'Comey began vocally criticising Trump following his dismissal, calling him “morally unfit” to be president and a threat to the norms of democracy in his 2018 memoir, A Higher Loyalty.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

Being migrants from the region, they told reporters, regardless of whether they had legal residency papers.', '“We suffered there,” one woman told France’s TV5 Monde, a baby perched on her hip. “It was really bad.”', 'The deportees are among hundreds of West Africans who have been rounded up by Mauritanian security forces, detained, and sent over the border to Senegal and Mali in recent months, human rights groups say.', 'According to one estimate from the Mauritanian Association for Human Rights (AMDH),1,200 people were pushed back in March alone, even though about 700 of them had residence permits.', 'Those pushed back told reporters about being randomly approached for questioning before being arrested, detained for days in tight prison cells with insufficient food and water, and tortured. Many people remained in prison in Mauritania, they said.', 'The largely desert country – which has signed expensive deals with the European Union to keep migrants from taking the risky boat journey across the Atlantic Ocean to Western shores – has called the pushbacks necessary to crack down on human smuggling networks.', 'However, its statements have done little to calm rare anger from its neighbours, Mali and Senegal, whose citizens make up a huge number of those sent back.', 'Mali’s government, in a statement in March, expressed “indignation” at the treatment of its nationals, adding that “the conditions of arrest are in flagrant violation of human rights and the rights of migrants in particular.”', 'In Senegal, a member of parliament called the pushbacks “xenophobic” and urged the government to launch an investigation.', '“We’ve seen these kinds of pushbacks in the past but it is at an intensity we’ve never seen before in terms of the number of people deported and the violence used,” Hassan Ould Moctar, a migration researcher at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London, told Al Jazeera.', 'The blame, the researcher said, was largely to be put on the EU. On one hand, Mauritania was likely under pressure from Brussels, and on the other hand, it was also likely reacting to controversial rumours that migrants deported from Europe would be resettled in the country despite Nouakchott’s denial of such an agreement.', 'Mauritania, on the edge of the Atlantic, is one of the closest points from the continent to Spain’s Canary Islands. That makes it a populardeparture point for migrantswho crowd the coastal capital, Nouakchott, and the commercial northern city of Nouadhibou. Most are trying to reach the Canaries, a Spanish enclave closer to the African continent than to Europe, from where they can seek asylum.', 'Due to its role as a transit hub, the EU has befriended Nouakchott – as well as the major transit points of Morocco and Senegal – since the 2000s, pumping funds to enable security officials there to prevent irregular migrants from embarking on the crossing.', 'However, the EU honed in on Mauritania with renewed vigour last year after the number of people travelling from the country shot up to unusual levels, making it the number one departure point.', 'About 83 percent of the 7,270 people who arrived in the Canaries in January 2024 travelled from Mauritania, migrant advocacy group Caminando Fronteras (CF) noted in a report last year. That number represented a 1,184 percent increase compared with January 2023, when most people were leaving Senegal. Some 3,600 died on the Mauritania-Atlantic route between January and April 2024, CF noted.', 'Analysts, and the EU, link the surge to upheavals wracking the Sahel, from Mali to Niger, including coups and attacks by several armed groups looking to build caliphates. In Mali, attacks on local communities by armed groups and government forces suspicious of locals have forced hundreds over the border into Mauritania in recent weeks.', 'Ibrahim Drame of the Senegalese Red Cross in the border town of Rosso told Al Jazeera the migrant raids began in January after a new immigration law went into force, requiring a residence permit for any foreigner living on Mauritanian soil. However, he said most people have not had an opportunity to apply for those permits. Before this, nationals of countries like Senegal and Mali enjoyed free movement under bilateral agreements.', '“Raids have been organised day and night, in large markets, around bus stations, and on the main streets,” Drame noted, adding that those affected are receiving dwindling shelter and food support from the Red Cross, and included migrants from Togo, Nigeria, Niger, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea Conakry, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ghana and Benin.', '“Hundreds of them were even hunted down in their homes or workplaces, without receiving the slightest explanation … mainly women, children, people with chronic illnesses in a situation of extreme vulnerability and stripped of all their belongings, even their mobile phones,” Drame said.', 'Last February, European Commission head, Ursula von der Leyen, visited President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani in Nouakchott to sign a 210 million euro ($235m) “migrant partnership agreement”. The EU said the agreement was meant to intensify “border security cooperation” with Frontex, the EU border agency, and dismantle smuggler networks. The bloc has promised an additional 4 million euros ($4.49m) this year to provide food, medical, and psychosocial support to migrants.', 'Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez was also in Mauritania in August to sign a separate border security agreement.', 'Black Mauritanians in the country, meanwhile, say the pushback campaign has awakened feelings of exclusion and forced displacement carried by their communities. Some fear the deportations may be directed at them.', 'Activist Abdoulaye Sow, founder of the US-based Mauritanian Network for Human Rights in the US (MNHRUS), told Al Jazeera that to understand why Black people in the country feel threatened, there’s a need to understand the country’s painful past.', 'Located at a confluence where the Arab world meets Sub-Saharan Africa, Mauritania has historically been racially segregated, with the Arab-Berber political elite dominating over the Black population, some of whom were previously, or are still, enslaved. It was only in1981 that Mauritania passed a law abolishing slavery, but the practice still exists, according to rights groups.', 'Dark-skinned Black Mauritanians are composed of Haratines, an Arabic-speaking group descended from formerly enslaved peoples. There are also non-Arabic speaking groups like the Fulani and Wolof, who are predominantly from the Senegal border area in the country’s south.', 'Black Mauritanians, Sow said, were once similarly deported en masse in trucks from the country to Senegal. It dates back to April 1989, when simmering tensions between Mauritanian herders and Senegalese farmers in border communities erupted and led to the 1989-1991 Border War between the two countries. Both sides deployed their militaries in heavy gunfire battles. In Senegal, mobs attacked Mauritanian traders, and in Mauritania, security forces cracked down on Senegalese nationals.', 'Because a Black liberation movement was also growing at the time, and the Mauritanian military government was fearful of a coup, it cracked down on Black Mauritanians, too.', 'By 1991, there were refugees on either side in the thousands. However, after peace came about, the Mauritanian government expelled thousands of Black Mauritanians under the guise of repatriating Senegalese refugees. Some 60,000 people were forced into Senegal. Many lost important citizenship and property documents in the process.', '“I was a victim too,” Sow said. “It wasn’t safe for Blacks who don’t speak Arabic. I witnessed armed people going house to house and asking people if they were Mauritanian, beating them, even killing them.”', 'Sow said it is why the deportation of sub-Saharan migrants is scaring the community. Although he has written open letters to the government warning of how Black people could be affected, he said there has been no response.', '“When they started these recent deportations again, I knew where they were going, and we’ve already heard of a Black Mauritanian deported to Mali. We’ve been sounding the alarm for so long, but the government is not responsive.”', 'The Mauritanian government directed Al Jazeera to an earlier statement it released regarding the deportations, but did not address allegations of possible forced expulsions of Black Mauritanians.', 'In the statement, the government said it welcomed legal migrants from neighbouring countries, and that it was targeting irregular migrants and smuggling networks.', '“Mauritania has made significant efforts to enable West African nationals to regularise their residence status by obtaining resident cards following simplified procedures,” the statement read.', 'Although Mauritania eventually agreed to take back its nationals between 2007 and 2012,\\xa0many Afro-Mauritanians still do not have documents proving their citizenship as successive administrations implement fluctuating documentation and census laws. Tens of thousands are presently stateless, Sow said. At least 16,000 refugees chose to stay back in Senegal to avoid persecution in Mauritania.', 'Sow said the fear of another forced deportation comes on top of other issues, including national laws that require students in all schools to learn in Arabic, irrespective of their culture. Arabic is Mauritania’s lingua franca, but Afro-Mauritanians who speak languages like Wolof or Pula are against what they call “forced Arabisation”. Sow says it is “cultural genocide”.', 'Despite new residence permit laws in place, Sow added, migrants, as well as the Black Mauritanian population, should be protected.', '“Whether they are migrants or not, they have their rights as people, as humans,” he said.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

According to the man’s family, the promise was not fulfilled, and he was placed in a state nursing home.', 'In response, Nawrocki has said he will donate the flat to charity and pointed out that under Trzaskowski’s mayorship, families had been evicted from state accommodation in Warsaw.', 'Nawrocki’s rally in Zabrze took a different tone – and featured a special guest. AlongsideGeorge Simion, the ultranationalist winner of the first round ofRomania’s presidential electionon May 4, Nawrocki took aim at the EU.', '“Together with Romania, when George Simion wins and when we win on May 18, we will build a Europe of Homelands, in which we will not allow the European Union to centralise and turn Poland and Romania into its provinces,” Nawrocki said.', 'Simion, together with the crowd, chanted “Donald Trump!” and called the United States president “a symbol of the fight for freedom which will transform the whole Europe”. Earlier this month, Nawrocki, who argues that Poland should focus on an alliance with the US rather than the EU, met with Trump in the White House and allegedly received his backing.', 'In the race for floating votes, both candidates have eased up on some of their parties’ more traditional positions. Nawrocki has abandoned Law and Justice’s commitment to a welfare state in exchange for a message of free market liberalism.', 'The more liberal Trzaskowski, for his part, has kept relatively quiet aboutwomen’sand LGBTQ rights, and embraced a harder line on security and immigration by promising to cut benefits for unemployed Ukrainians who have taken refuge in Poland from the war with Russia and endorsing his government’ssuspension of asylum rightslast year over what Poland sees as Belarus facilitating migrants to cross their shared border.', 'Security and anti-migrant rhetoric have been a key feature in this election, as both main candidates lean closer to the views of the populist Slawomir Mentzen, a tax adviser turned leader of the ultranationalist, conservative Confederation party. He has called for migrants crossing from Belarus to be fired upon, is opposed to welfare payments for Ukrainians and is likely to emerge as third in the presidential race.', '“In public opinion polls and focus groups, among all voters, including voters of the new left, there has been a visible anti-Ukrainian trend, which has social and economic rather than cultural roots,” said Bartosz Rydlinski, a political scientist from Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University in Warsaw.', '“Poles are not angry at Ukrainians for living separately or not speaking Polish. [But] in a country with highly limited access to public services, there is an irrational sense of injustice. There is a sense that Ukrainians do not work, but use healthcare. Which is nonsense, because most Ukrainians work and pay taxes.”', 'At the Krakow meeting, amid the sea of Polish and European flags, the crowd rallied for value-based politics – and change.', '“I want to live in a normal country, I want my daughter to grow up in a normal country, in a country with a positive attitude, without any negative emotions. Poland deserves to develop, to be respected in the world and that is why I came here today,” Anna Szol, a 48-year-old entrepreneur, who joined Trzaskowski’s rally with her daughter, told Al Jazeera.', 'When asked about the situation at the Polish-Belarusian border – where, since 2021, thousands of migrants to Europe have crossed – and the suspension of asylum rights, Szol, just like her candidate, said she agrees that the move is justified.', '“This is the result of Putin’s and Lukashenko’s actions to send to the border poor people who are not aware of what’s going on. Human traffickers are often involved. This is a NATO border and it simply has to be extra secure,” Szol said.', 'However, Rydlinski said such a suspension of human rights would embolden the far-right agenda in the longer term and weaken liberal parties.', '“The difference between liberal and populist parties should be that liberal parties treat human rights seriously,” Rydlinski says. “Research shows that when liberal and left-wing parties accommodate far-right issues, they do not win populist voters, but lose their own.”', 'The winner of this presidential election will be crucial for the current government, which has been hamstrung from carrying out reforms by the current president, who has used his power of veto to block them.', 'This includes the reversal of controversial judicial reforms introduced by the Law and Justice government during its eight-year rule. The European Court of Justice deemed several Law and Justice judicial reforms as contradicting EU law, especially regarding the independence of the judiciary, and imposed penalties on Poland beginning in 2021.', '“What is at stake in the election is whether the current government is going to be able to carry out its programme in full. One of the key things that has been characteristic of the political scene over the last 18 months is that the government has been essentially blocked in a number of things that it has committed to do,” said Ben Stanley, a sociologist and political scientist at the SWPS University in Warsaw.', '“If Nawrocki wins, it will certainly lead to the maintenance of the situation as it is currently with a hostile president vetoing or threatening to veto what the government wants to do. That will affect both the rule of law issues and also many of the elements on the government’s legislative agenda,” Stanley said.', '“It will also send a signal to voters that Law and Justice is capable of winning the next election and that if it does win the next elections [in November 2027], it will have its president in place.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

He also rejected the idea that innocent people might be caught in those areas.', '“The New Mexico National Defense Area is a crucial installation necessary to strengthen the authority of servicemembers to help secure our borders and safeguard the country,” Ellison said.', 'He noted that the government had put up “restricted area” signs along the border. But the public defender’s office in New Mexico argued that the government had not done enough to make it sufficiently clear to migrants in the area that they were entering a military zone.', 'In the US, the public defenders noted that trespassing requires that the migrants were aware of the restriction and acted “in defiance of that regulation for some nefarious or bad purpose”.', 'Despite this week’s dismissals, the migrants involved still face less severe charges of crossing the border illegally.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

The voyage was meant to be a celebratory outing following Lynch’s acquittal in a major fraud case in the United States just two months earlier.', 'In a preliminary report released on Thursday, the UK’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) found that the vessel was “vulnerable” to strong winds – potentially even less severe than those recorded at the time of the incident. The report noted that this vulnerability was unknown to the yacht’s owner and crew, as it had not been documented in the stability guidance available on board.', 'The agency launched its probe because the Bayesian was registered in the UK. However, it acknowledged that access to key evidence remains limited due to an ongoingcriminal inquiry by Italian authorities.', 'According to the UK report, the Bayesian had been moved the day before the accident to what was believed to be a safer location in anticipation of thunderstorms. But at about 4:06am local time, with the vessel in a motoring state, sails stowed and the centreboard raised, it was hit by winds exceeding 70 knots (81 mph), which caused it to capsize within seconds.', '“You have the wind pushing the vessel over and then you have the stability of the vessel trying to push the vessel back upright again,” said MAIB investigator Simon Graves. “What our studies found was that the Bayesian may have been vulnerable to high winds, and these winds were likely present at the time of the accident.”', 'Among the other victims were Jonathan and Judy Bloomer – both British nationals – Chris and Neda Morvillo from the US, and Canadian Antiguan chef Recaldo Thomas. Fifteen people survived, including Lynch’s wife, Angela Bacares.', 'Efforts to recover the yacht have stalled since May 9, when a diver was killed during the operation. Salvage work resumed on Thursday. Graves said the final report will cover additional factors such as possible escape routes and what took place on board.', '“There’s still more to uncover,” he said. “Once we gain access to the yacht itself, we’ll be able to paint a fuller picture of the timeline and decisions made.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

In the months that followed, two other federal judges joined in issuingnationwide injunctions.', 'On Thursday, the issue will reach the US Supreme Court, with the 6-3 conservative dominated bench set to hear oral arguments in the case. What the court decides could be transformative.', 'Proponents have long argued that the practice of granting citizenship to all those born on US soil is woven into the national fabric.', 'American Civil Liberties Union executive director Anthony Romero did not mince words in January, when he called Trump’s order a “reckless and ruthless repudiation of American values”, destined to create a “permanent subclass of people born in the US who are denied full rights as Americans”.', 'Meanwhile, a smaller but vocal contingency, empowered by Trump, has maintained that the practice is based on faulty constitutional interpretation and serves as an incentive for undocumented migration. The Trump administration has called it “birth tourism”.', 'Here’s what to expect from Thursday’s hearing:', 'The hearing will start at 9am local (14:00 GMT).', 'The most fundamental question that could be answered by the top court is whether birthright citizenship will be allowed to continue.', 'Proponents point to the US Constitution’s 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868, which reads: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside”.', 'A subsequent 1898 Supreme Court case, United States v Wong Kim Ark, interpreted the language as applying to all immigrants, creating a precedent that has since stood.', 'Some studies estimate that about 150,000 immigrant infants are born with citizenship every year under the policy.', 'The Trump administration, in contrast, hasembracedthe theory that babies born to noncitizens are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the US, and therefore are not constitutionally guaranteed citizenship.', 'Speaking to reporters in April, Trump described a scenario of “tourists coming in and touching a piece of sand and then all of a sudden, there’s citizenship”. He has embraced the theory that the 14th Amendment was meant to apply only to former slaves, and not newly arriving immigrants', 'At the time, Trump predicted it would be “easy” to win the case based on that logic.', 'Yes. The Trump administration has taken a strategically unique tack in the case.', 'In their emergency filing to the Supreme Court, they have focused on the actions of the three judges who blocked Trump’s order from going into effect nationwide.', 'They argue the orders extend beyond the judges’ authorities and should only apply to the plaintiffs or jurisdictions directly connected to Trump’s executive order.', 'Theoretically, the Supreme Court could rule on whether the judges can issue nationwide injunctions, without ruling on whether birthright citizenship is, in fact, protected by the Constitution.', 'For example, if the justices rule that the lower judges exceeded their power, but do not make a determination on the constitutional merits of birthright citizenship, the executive order would only be blocked in the 22 states that successfully challenged Trump’s order.', 'Attorneys General in those states had challenged the order in a joint lawsuit, with a federal judge in Massachusetts ruling in their favour in February.', 'Birthright citizenship would effectively be banned in 28 other states unless they also successfully challenge the order or until the Supreme Court makes a future ruling.', 'The possibility has split legal scholars, with some arguing it is unlikely the Supreme Court would make the narrower decision on the scope of the lower judges’ power without also ruling on the underlying constitutional merits of birthright citizenship.', 'Yes. If the justices do decide to only address the scope of the lower judges’ power, the implications could extend far beyond the birthright citizenship question.', 'It would also apply to several other Trump executive orders that have been blocked by a federal judge’s national injunction, also called “universal injunctions”. Those include several Trump executive orders seeking to unilaterally transform the federal government, the military, and how funding is disbursed to states, to name a few.', 'In a written filing in the birthright citizenship case, the Department of Justice pointed to the wider implications, saying the need for the Supreme Court’s “intervention has become urgent as universal injunctions have reached tsunami levels”.', 'Meanwhile, the plaintiffs in the Maryland case that successfully challenged Trump’s birthright order said doing away with national injunctions would create different tiers of rights depending on an individual’s geographical location.', '“An infant would be a United States citizen and full member of society if born in New Jersey, but a deportable noncitizen if born in Tennessee,” they wrote in a court filing.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

Dan, a former mathematician, followed with about 20 percent.', 'The first round came in the wake of the controversial annulment of Romania’s October 2024 presidential election, in which ultranationalist underdog candidate Calin Georgescu advanced to the final. The constitutional court cited reasons of irregular financing and suspected foreign interference.', 'Simion has promised to redo the second round of the 2024 election if the Romanian public so desires.', 'A supporter of banned candidate Georgescu, Simion is likely to have swept up much of his base in the first round and has spoken of promoting Georgescu to the role of prime minister.', '“After the annulment, completely abusive and unfounded, of the [2024] elections, Romanians have seen the ugliest face of this deep state that decides beyond the will of the people,” Simion told Al Jazeera.', 'A divisive figure, he is banned from entering Ukraine and Moldova. He has previously called to restore Romania’s old borders. He is also sceptical about sending more military aid to Ukraine. He has organised nationalist rallies in the past, as well as demonstrations against corruption. He founded AUR in 2020.', '“I have promised that the first thing I will do as president is to unseal the files on the annulment of the elections. To do justice, we must know the truth,” said Simion.', 'Romania’s 2024 election fallout earned the nation criticism from high-profile populists who claimed free speech was being threatened. US Vice President JD Vance condemned the annulment at the Munich Security Conference, saying the ruling was based on the “flimsy suspicions of an intelligence agency”.', 'Political analyst Anamaria-Nicoleta Ciobanu defined Simion as a “chameleonic leader” who began his career as a moderate, but has since shifted towards the hard right.', '“Most of Simion’s voters are not extremists; they are only disappointed in how the Romanian political and economic space looks”, she said.', 'Simion maintains an official stance of neutrality on the Ukraine war, but voters tend to be drawn to his anti-establishment message.', '“The establishment, made by old socialist and liberal parties, which have been in power for 35 years, has always talked about ensuring stability. This stability has turned out to be not just an illusion, but a huge lie. Romania has been recently downgraded to a hybrid regime,” Simion told Al Jazeera.', 'In 2024, Romania was moved down 12 places to number 72 in a Democracy Index published by The Economist, falling out of the category “flawed democracy” and into “hybrid regime”, a mixture of authoritarianism and democracy.', 'Despite committing to staying in both the EU and NATO, Simion is critical of Europe.', '“The federalist super-state that the globalist left is creating is not what European citizens want,” he said.', 'Last week, Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu from the Party of European Socialists (PSD) resigned following his government coalition’s failure to secure their candidate, Crin Antonescu, in the run-off.

Dan’s team raised 600,000 euros ($670,000) to support the campaign.', 'After trailing Simion by nearly 20 percent in the first round, he needs a large dose of support to win Sunday’s run-off.', '“I sympathise entirely with voters feeling left behind,” Dan told Al Jazeera.

Putin referenced direct talks that took place in 2022 while pitching for their resumption.', '“It was not Russia that broke off negotiations in 2022. It was Kyiv. Nevertheless, we are proposing that Kyiv resume direct negotiations without any preconditions,” Putin said on Sunday.', 'In February 2022, Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Shortly after, Russia and Ukraine held talks in the Turkish capital, Istanbul.', 'According to Zelenskyy, the talks fell apart because Russia demanded that Ukraine concede the Donbas region, which spans Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions – parts of which Russia occupied during its invasion. Zelenskyy added that Russia wanted Ukraine to surrender long-range weaponry, make constitutional amendments to declare neutrality and significantly reduce its armed forces. “There were never any negotiations; it was an ultimatum from a murderer,” Zelenskyy said at the time.', 'While Zelenskyy had earlier held that any peace agreement would require Russia to give up Ukrainian territory it had occupied, in December last year,Zelenskyy saidthe “hot phase” of the war could end if NATO offered security guarantees for the part of Ukraine currently under Kyiv’s control.', 'He added that the return of land that Russia has occupied could be diplomatically negotiated later.', '“The pressure that the US has exerted to attempt to bring an end to the fighting in Ukraine has evolved over time,” Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at the London-based Chatham House think tank, told Al Jazeera. “It appears that the most recent elements in that evolution, particularly in terms of European solidarity with Ukraine, have led Russia to engage in direct talks.”', 'Putin’s recent push for talks came a day after Ukraine’s four major European allies gave Putin an ultimatum to accept an unconditional 30-day ceasefire or face renewed sanctions. This ultimatum came after leaders of the European countries, France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland, visited Kyiv.', 'They gave Putin a deadline until May 12. On Sunday, May 11, Putin – without committing to a ceasefire – said: “We are committed to serious negotiations with Ukraine. Their purpose is to eliminate the root causes of the conflict, to establish a long-term, lasting peace for the historical perspective.”', 'The talks are scheduled to start at approximately 10am local time (07:00 GMT), according to Russia’s TASS news agency. They are being held behind closed doors in Dolmabahce Palace in the Turkish city of Istanbul, which straddles the boundary between Asia and Europe.', 'The palace, which sits on the Bosphorus Strait, was the main administrative complex of the Ottoman Empire for most of the period between the mid-19th century and 1922.', 'The four European leaders – Britain’s Keir Starmer, France’s Emmanuel Macron, Germany’s Friedrich Merz and Poland’s Donald Tusk – said that they had briefed Trump about their ultimatum to Russia over a phone call and suggested that he was on board.', 'But after Putin called for direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow, Trump issued a statement on his Truth Social platform asking Ukraine to meet with Russia “immediately”.', 'Trump ran his campaign for the 2024 election on the promise to bring a swift end to the Ukraine war. The Trump administration held multiple meetings, starting February, with Russian and Ukrainian representatives separately in Saudi Arabia in attempts to broker a deal.', 'Also in April, the Trump administration indicated that it was taking a step back from providing security guarantees to Ukraine. The Trump administration said it wanted Europe to take the lead in supporting Ukraine’s defence instead, noting that the US had other priorities, including border security.', 'In recent weeks, however, Trump and his team, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have expressed growing frustration at the lack of meaningful progress in negotiations and have threatened to walk out of efforts to mediate peace.', 'Explaining his insistence that Ukraine join the May 15 Istanbul talks, Trump argued:\\xa0“At least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible, and if it is not, European leaders, and the US, will know where everything stands, and can proceed accordingly!”', '“I supported President Trump with the idea of direct talks with Putin. I have openly expressed my readiness to meet. I will be in Turkiye. I hope that the Russians will not evade the meeting,” Zelenskyy wrote in an X post on Monday.', 'On Tuesday, Zelenskyy announced he will be in Ankara on Thursday, where he will meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The talks with Russia, however, are supposed to be held in Istanbul subsequently.', 'Trump has said he will send Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg to attend the talks in Istanbul.', 'Russia on Wednesday night announced its team for the meeting. Vladimir Medinsky, a close Putin aide and former culture minister who also led previous rounds of unsuccessful talks with Ukraine in 2022, will lead Moscow’s team. With him will be Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin and the director of the Main Intelligence Directorate, Igor Kostyukov.', 'Trump’s earlier offer to attend the talks himself had been welcomed by Kyiv. “All of us in Ukraine would appreciate it if President Trump could be there with us at this meeting in Turkiye. This is the right idea. We can change a lot,” Zelenskyy had said.', 'However, late on Wednesday, US officials clarified that Trump would not be attending.', 'The US president is currently in the Middle East, where he spent Wednesday in Qatar, after visiting Saudi Arabia a day earlier. On Thursday, Trump will be in the United Arab Emirates before returning to Washington.', 'Zelenskyy had earlier said he would be present at the talksonly if Putinalso attended. “Putin is the one who determines everything in Russia, so he is the one who has to resolve the war. This is his war. Therefore, the negotiations should be with him,” Zelenskyy said in a post on X on Tuesday.', 'With Putin now no longer poised to attend, it is unclear if Zelenskyy will personally participate in the talks or whether he will leave it to his team to join the negotiations.', 'Yet, in many ways, Zelenskyy scored over Putin by throwing down the gauntlet and asking him to attend.', '“Zelenskyy has presented a challenge to Russia to show that it has genuine interest; it is up to Russia whether it meets this challenge or not,” said Giles.', 'Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had alsopledgedto urge Putin to attend the talks.', 'It is difficult to predict what might specifically be discussed in the Turkiye talks.', '“It would be rash to predict whether there will be any meaningful discussion at all, since the acceptable outcomes for both are still far apart,” Giles said. “Russia wants to neutralise Ukraine as an independent sovereign state, while Ukraine wants to survive.”', 'At the moment, Ukraine has proposed an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, while Russia has insisted that a series of its demands be accepted before it joins such a truce. Moscow said that it wants assurances over the monitoring mechanism for a ceasefire, and that a truce won’t be used by Ukraine to rearm and mobilise more soldiers. Instead, Putin has announced brief, unilateral ceasefires in recent days that Ukraine says Moscow never actually adhered to.', '“We do not rule out that, during these negotiations, it will be possible to agree on some new truces, a new ceasefire and a real truce, which would be observed not only by Russia, but also by the Ukrainian side. [It] would be the first step, I repeat, to a long-term sustainable peace, and not a prologue to the continuation of the armed conflict,” Putin said on Sunday.', 'Giles said that if the talks happen, “they will be a significant step forward”.', 'He added: “Anything that has been referred to as peace talks [ so far] has not been anything of the sort,” describing the two parallel discussions that the US has had with Russia and Ukraine.', 'On March 19, the US, Ukraine and Russia announced a30-day ceasefireon attacks on Russian and Ukrainian energy infrastructure, and on March 25, they agreed on aBlack Sea deal, halting the military use of commercial vessels and the use of force in the Black Sea.

Since its establishment three decades ago, the group has become one of the most prominent forces in Bolivian politics.', 'Still, in the lead-up to August’s election, Arce saw his poll numbers decline. Bolivia’s inflation over the past year has ballooned to its highest level in a decade, and the value of its currency has plummeted.', 'The country’s central bank has run low on its reserves of hard currency, and a black market has emerged where the value of the Bolivian currency is half its official exchange rate. And where once the country was an exporter of natural gas, it now relies on imports to address energy shortages.', 'While experts say some of these issues predate Arce’s term in office, public sentiment has nevertheless turned against his administration. That, in turn, has led some to speculate that Bolivia could be in store for a political shift this election year.', 'Arce himself has had to deal with the power of a rising right-wing movement in Bolivia. In 2022, for instance, his government’s decision to delay a countrywide census sparkeddeadly protestsin areas like Santa Cruz, where some Christian conservative activists expected surveys to show growth.', 'That population increase was expected to lead to more government funds, and potentially boost the number of legislative seats assigned to the department.', 'Arce also faced opposition from within his own coalition, most notably from Morales, his former boss. He had previously served as an economy and finance minister under Morales.', 'The division between the two leaders translated into a schism in the MAS membership, with some identifying as Morales loyalists and others backing Arce.', 'That split came to a headin June 2024, when Arce’s hand-picked army general, Juan Jose Zuniga, ledan unsuccessful coup d’etatagainst him. Zunigapublicly blamedArce for Bolivia’s impoverishment, as well as mismanagement in the government.', 'Morales has seized upon the popular discontent to advance his own ambitions of seeking a fourth term as president. After the coup, helaunched a protest marchagainst his former political ally and tried to set an ultimatum to force changes.', 'After dropping out of the 2025 presidential race on Wednesday, Arce called for “the broadest unity” in Bolivia’s left-wing political movement. He said a show of strength behind a single candidate was necessary for “defeating the plunderers of Bolivia”.', '“Only the united struggle of the people ensures the best future for Bolivia. Our vote will be united against the threat of the right and fascism,” he wrote on social media.', 'But a wild card remains on the left of Bolivia’s political spectrum: Morales himself.', 'Considered Bolivia’s first Indigenous president, Morales remains a relatively popular figure, though recent scandals have dented his broad appeal.', 'First elected as president in 2005, Morales was re-elected twice. But his attempts to remain in office culminated with the 2019 election and subsequent political crisis, which saw Morales resign and flee abroad amidaccusations that his victory was the result of electoral fraud.', 'Morales has long sought a fourth term as president. In 2016, a referendum was put to Bolivia’s voters that would have scrapped presidential term limits, but it was rejected. Still, Morales appealed to Bolivia’s Constitutional Court, and in 2019, it allowed him to seek a fourth term.', 'That led to accusations that Morales had overturned the will of the voters in an anti-democratic power grab.', 'But the court has since walked back that precedent, reversing its decision four years later in 2023. It has since upheld that decision on term limitsmultiple times, most recently on Wednesday, effectively barring Morales from the upcoming August race.', 'Separately, last October, Morales faced charges of statutory rape for allegedly fathering a child with a 15-year-old girl while president. Morales has denied any wrongdoing and has sought to evade warrants issued for his arrest.', 'Media reports indicate he is holed up with supporters in the rural department of Cochabamba in the north of Bolivia.', 'Still, in February, Morales announced his bid for re-election. And on Wednesday, he denounced the Constitutional Court’s latest ruling upholding Bolivia’s two-term limit as a violation of his human rights. He also framed it as part of a broader pattern of foreign interference.', '“It is a political and partisan ruling that obeys the orders of the eternal enemy of the people: the US empire,” he wrote on social media.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

And the meeting was extraordinary for a number of reasons: Until December, the US had offered a $10m reward for al-Sharaa’s capture.', 'It continues to list Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the armed group al-Sharaa led during Syria’s civil war, as a “foreign terrorist organisation”, due to its past ties with al-Qaeda.', 'But since a coalition led by HTS toppled the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December, the US has been reevaluating its relationship with the group and its leadership.', 'The toppling of al-Assad’s government brought an end to Syria’s nearly 13-year-long civil war, and al-Assad — long accused of human rights abuses — fled to Russia.', 'In the lead-up to Wednesday’s meeting with al-Sharaa, Trump announced that he would lift the sanctions against Syria put in place during al-Assad’s leadership, a development that al-Sharaa’s government praised as an economic boon and a step towards stability.', 'On Wednesday, al-Sharaa joined Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman for an in-person meeting, while Turkiye’s President Recep Erdogan joined by phone.', 'Trump “told President Al-Sharaa that he has a tremendous opportunity to do something historic in his country”, according to aread-outfrom the White House. He also encouraged Syria to expel “foreign terrorists” and “Palestinian terrorists” from its borders, as well as normalise relations with Israel.', 'The read-out added that al-Sharaa said he shared the US’s interests in “countering terrorism and eliminating chemical weapons”. He also encouraged the US to invest in Syria’s petroleum sector.', 'Later, as he boarded Air Force One for Qatar, reporters asked Trump to share his first impressions of al-Sharaa.', '“Great.

The country’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani was on hand to welcome him.

He called the plane a “GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE” that was made “in a very public and transparent transaction”.', 'He also walked back media reports that he would use the aircraft as personal transport after leaving office.

On Monday, the US and China released a joint statement announcing the deal.', 'The two countries acknowledged the importance of their “bilateral economic and trade relationship” as well as the importance of a “sustainable, long-term, and mutually beneficial economic and trade relationship”.', 'The US and China agreed to establish a mechanism to continue discussing trade relations. China also agreed to “suspend or cancel” non-tariff measures against the US, but did not provide any details.', 'Speaking to reporters in Geneva last weekend, China’s Vice Premier He described the talks as “candid, in-depth and constructive”.', 'For his part, US Treasury Secretary Bessent told Bloomberg Television on Monday that “both sides agree we do not want a generalised decoupling.”', '“The US is going to do a strategic decoupling in terms of the items that we discovered during COVID were ofnational security interests– whether it’s semiconductors, medicine, steel,” Bessent said.', 'After the talks concluded, Trump praised negotiations as a “great trade deal”, adding “we’re not looking to hurt China.” He then claimed a personal win, saying he had engineered a “total reset” with Beijing.', 'Elsewhere, Hu Xijin, former editor of the Chinese state-run Global Times publication, said on social media that the deal was “a great victory for China”.', 'After the tariff pause had been announced, Bessent said it’s “implausible” that reciprocal tariffs on China will fall below 10 percent. However, he said the April 2 level – set by President Trump at 34 percent – “would be a ceiling”.', 'He also said “we could see some amount of the fentanyl tariffs… come off.” Earlier this year, Trump put a 20 percent tariff on China, accusing it of not doing enough to stop the flow offentanyl, a highly addictive and deadly opioid, into the US.', 'For now, Chinese goods will continue face a 30 percent tariff. In addition, specific products from China, such as electric vehicles, steel and aluminium, are subject to even higher, separate tariffs imposed in recent years.', 'On Monday, the White House also issued an executive order lowering duties onlow-value packages– items costing up to $800 – from China from 120 to 54 percent.', 'And while a minimum $100 fee on packages from e-commerce sites Temu and Shein will remain in place, the increase to $200 planned for June 1 was dropped.', 'On the flip side, Beijing pledged to suspend non-tariff forms of retaliation imposed since April 2, such as export restrictions on critical minerals that US manufacturers use in high-tech equipment and clean energy technology.', 'Notably, the deal does not include concessions from Beijing on several US sticking points, like itshuge trade surpluswith the US or its exchange rate policy, China is accused of keeping its renminbi artificially low in order to boost export sales.', 'Tariff suspensions will be in place for 90 days. They will be subject to reviews based on broad negotiations in the coming weeks and months.', 'The speed with which the US and China unwound their tariffs, taking many analysts by surprise, suggests the trade war was inflicting pain on both sides.', 'The tariffs werethreateningjob losses for Chinese factory workers and higher inflation and empty shelves for American consumers.', 'But for Piergiuseppe Fortunato, an adjunct professor of economics at the University of Neuchatel in Switzerland, it is clear who wanted the deal more badly.', '“First of all, America made more concessions than China. Second, America’s economy, which is unsteady at the moment, is more reliant on China’s than the other way around.”', 'In April, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that the US economy was facing an increased risk of recession as Trump’s trade war – and the accompanying increase in consumer prices – could unleash a “significant slowdown”.', 'Fortunato told Al Jazeera that “Beijing is not in such a precarious position. Take, for example, its latest export figures.”', 'China’s exports grew sharply in April. The strong performance, an 8.2 percent increase from the year before, came as Chinese firms diverted trade flows to Southeast Asia, Europe and other destinations.', '“I think that Washington overplayed its hand with Beijing,” says Fortunato.', '“The White House overestimated the importance of the US market, and underestimated China’s success indiversifying its exports away from the USsince the first Trump trade war” in 2018.', '“It could take a long time to reach a detailed agreement, if one is even possible,” notes Fortunato.', 'In 2018, the US backed away\\xa0from a potential trade deal following talks with Beijing. The next 18 months saw tariff exchanges before aPhase Onedeal was signed in January 2020.', 'However, China did not meet all the terms of that purchase agreement. It fell some 43 percent short of the $200bn worth of goods it agreed to buy from the US by 2021.', 'Then, the US trade deficit with China jumped up during the COVID-19 pandemic, setting the stage for the current trade war.', 'Earlier this week, Bessent once again hinted that Washington might be looking for the type of “purchase agreements” that characterised the Phase One deal.', '“The US has made noises that it may be going for more purchase agreements. But the American economy took a hit last time from similar arrangements,” says Fortunato.', 'During Trump’s\\xa0first trade war with China, the US-China Business Council estimated that 245,000 US jobs were lost.', 'As the scope of tariffs is greater today, even after last weekend’s announcement, it’s fair to assume that even more jobs will be shed.', 'In the future, Fortunato suspects the US will “land at an average tariff rate of 15-20 percent, and even higher for China. That’s five times greater than what it was in January… a massive change.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

But the remarks he had originally drafted months earlier, during the summer, had begun to feel stale.', \"Something more recent was weighing on his mind: Israel's war on Gaza.\", 'Since the war began that October, Nguyen had watched coverage showing Palestinian families erased overnight, neighbourhoods levelled to dust and starvation wielded as a weapon.', 'But he had also felt the sting of public backlash for speaking out. Criticism of the war was often accompanied by accusations of anti-Semitism or indifference to the suffering of captives held in Gaza by the armed group Hamas.', 'For artists like Nguyen, the consequences could be lost contracts and cancelled gigs.', 'Nguyen had already seen his scheduled talk at New York’s 92nd Street Y — a major cultural institution in the United States — abruptly paused after he signed a letter denouncing the violence in Gaza.', 'As he prepared to resume the podium at Harvard, he faced a choice: to confront what he saw as a present-day injustice — and accept the pushback — or avoid the subject entirely.', 'He decided to do what he felt was uncomfortable, but necessary.', '\"It’s easy to talk about darkness in history,\" he told Al Jazeera. \"But are we willing to confront what’s happening right now, right in front of our faces, in Palestine?\"', \"That lecture series became the basis for Nguyen's latest book, To Save and to Destroy, released in the US last month.\", \"In its pages, Nguyen — the winner of a 2016 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, one of the country's highest literary honours — lays out the argument that writers are never neutral.\", 'They are entangled in the very systems they seek to portray.', 'Merging memoir, criticism and political reflection, it is a book preoccupied with power: who holds it, who resists it and what is at stake when artists dare to speak freely.', 'Nguyen knows this terrain firsthand. After all, the currents of international power have shaped his life, starting from an early age.', 'Born in 1971, in the midst of the Vietnam War, Nguyen was only four years old when the North Vietnamese forces made their final push to secure their grip on the country.', \"Faced with soldiers sweeping south, Nguyen, his mother and his older brother fled their hometown of Buôn Ma Thuột by foot. On a boat to Saigon, they were reunited with Nguyen's father and began their journey to the US as refugees.\", 'Confronting the history and politics of that era has been a defining theme in his work.', 'The Sympathizer — his Pulitzer-winning debut — explores the fractured identities and divided loyalties of a spy in the aftermath of the war. His nonfiction, including Nothing Ever Dies, offers a lens on how memories of wartime can be warped and manipulated.', '“War, memory, identity — that triangle made me American,” Nguyen told Al Jazeera.', 'While some prize escapism in literature, Nguyen finds inspiration in confronting the thorniness of politics. His work has earned him several prestigious awards, ranging from the Guggenheim Fellowship to the MacArthur \"genius grant\".', '\"The idea that art is political isn’t a deformation of art. It’s a fulfilment of it,\" he said.', 'But the political climate surrounding the war in Gaza has presented new challenges for Nguyen and other writers.', 'As far back as 2016, Nguyen had expressed support for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), a nonviolent protest movement against Israel to support Palestinian rights.', 'In October 2023, he signed an open letter published in the London Review of Books, alongside more than 750 other writers, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and condemning Israel’s military actions.', 'But the fallout was swift. The cancellation of his talk at the 92nd Street Y sparked national media attention and intense public debate.', '\"I hope there is a moral consensus that killing civilians is wrong, whether Hamas does it or whether Israel does it,\" he wrote in response on social media.', 'Still, some commenters criticised him for claiming a \"moral equivalence\" between the two sides.', 'Nguyen underscored that his platform is not a shield: He still faces backlash to his work.', '\"People simply don\\'t talk to me any more, people have thrown me out of their circles, or I\\'ve lost invitations to things,\" he said.', 'Still, he acknowledged that his standing in the literary community has helped make the \"price\" of his choices \"manageable\".', '\"I speak from a position of privilege,\" he said. \"My titles, my professional status — maybe they protect me a little.\"', 'Other writers, he added, are more vulnerable, and the consequences of speaking out can be more severe.', 'In May 2021, for instance, a 22-year-old Associated Press staffer, Emily Wilder, was fired after right-wing media resurfaced pro-Palestinian statements she made while in college.', 'More recently, in March, the administration of President Donald Trump detained Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish PhD student studying at Tufts University, and stripped her of her visa.', 'Her supporters say she did little more than co-write an op-ed critical of the university\\'s refusal to \"acknowledge the Palestinian genocide\". Though she has been released from government custody, she continues to face deportation proceedings.', 'One culture writer and critic, speaking to Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity, explained that he fears that speaking out on issues like the war in Gaza could jeopardise his work visa status in the US.', 'In addition to his work as a writer, he has a background in film and television, having taken on roles as a director, screenwriter and editor for several international projects.', '\"In the last couple of months, I’ve felt this overwhelming guilt, like I’m choosing my own safety over speaking out. It’s the first time I’ve really felt that way,\" he said.', '\"I’ve done a couple of on-camera interviews for the BBC, where I wore a Palestinian keffiyeh and was very outspoken. But I don’t see myself doing that in the near future.\"', 'He added that he has friends with green cards who were unexpectedly interrogated upon re-entering the US, despite their status as permanent residents.', '\"After Trump’s re-election, I told myself, \\'This time, I’m not going to stay angry and frustrated. I’m just going to put my head down and keep moving forward,\\'\" he said.', \"Celine Parreñas Shimizu, the dean of the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, believes voices like Nguyen's can help break the silence that results from such crackdowns and threats.\", '\"Critical acclaim\", she explained, \"enables creativity in response to the forces that seek to silence us\".', 'But she, too, warned that no amount of accolades could fully protect an author from damage to their reputation or lost opportunities.', '\"Critical or professional acclaim offers no true shield against racism\\'s fundamental dehumanisation,\" Parreñas Shimizu said.', 'The pressures on young, emerging writers weigh heavily on Nguyen, who has witnessed similar struggles among his students at the University of Southern California.', '\"Young writers here, they’re like writers everywhere. They’re afraid of not getting published. They’re afraid of not having a life in the audience,\" Nguyen said.', 'Those fears can lead to life-altering decisions, Nguyen explained. \"I’ve had a writer who is trans. They left the US a few weeks ago, terrified, and removed themselves to another country.\"', 'When he talks to his students, he emphasises the time and difficulty involved in pursuing a career in writing, no matter the circumstances.', '\"What I try to do with those writers is impress upon them that it took 30 years of misery to get to where I am. Every writer is alone. You have to cultivate discipline within yourself to confront that solitude.\"', 'But even so, those closest to Nguyen wonder about the toll his writing and public activism can take.', \"Thi Bui, a cartoonist, first bonded with Nguyen during a writers' residency run by the Diasporic Vietnamese Artists Network (DVAN). They have collaborated on a children's book in the years since.\", 'Bui told Al Jazeera that she admires the way Nguyen takes on each of his roles — writer, activist, father — with equal strength.', '\"He takes things head-on,\" she said. \"He channels his anger into writing fast.\"', 'But she has also noticed the pressure he faces for speaking out, even at times when silence might be easier.', '\"He’s always carrying more than he lets on,\" Bui said. \"Even when he’s joking or smiling, you can feel the heaviness behind it. I sometimes worry about that. As much as he works on the world, there’s always a lot of trauma he’s had to grapple with.\"', 'But for Nguyen, speaking out is part of his cultural framework — an inextricable part of himself.', '\"I grew up Catholic. Pope Francis just died, and I’ve been thinking about him,\" he said. \"That tradition taught me about justice — not as a slogan, but something spiritual. Jesus was a truth-teller. That mattered.\"', 'His writing, he says, is tied to that spiritual inheritance.', '\"I carry that obligation with me.\"', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

On the table before them were two blue folders, two drinking glasses and a small white object. The three men smiled for photographers who had gathered. Just as the shutter clicks started, Macron removed the crumpled white object from the tabletop and held it in his fist.', '“DEVELOPING SCANDAL: Macron, Starmer, and Merz caught on video on their return from Kiev. A bag of white powder on the table. Macron quickly pockets it, Merz hides the spoon,” Jones\\xa0said\\xa0in a May 11 X post. “No explanation given. (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky, known cocaine enthusiast, had just hosted them. All three of the ‘leaders’ look completely cracked out.”', 'Jones’s post had been viewed more than 29.5 million times as of May 13 and he promoted the drug-use narrative in several more posts. “BREAKING: It’s Coke,” he said in another May 11 post later that day. A few hours later, he shared another photo that he said “clearly” showed “a bag of Blow”. Similar posts spread in Spanish.', 'Jones did not respond toPolitiFact’s request for comment. But original videos of the meeting by the AFP news agency and The Associated Press and high-resolution photos captured by AP showed the white object Macron removed from the table was not a bag of white powder – it was a tissue.', 'Elysee, the official X account of the French presidency and the Elysse Palace presidential residence, posted pictures that also showed what appeared to be a tissue on the table. It said on X that the white object was a tissue “for blowing your nose”, adding that “this fake news is being spread by France’s enemies, both abroad and at home. We must remain vigilant against manipulation.”', 'In an email to PolitiFact, a German government spokesperson described Jones’s allegation as “absurd”.', 'Jones’s post also got another detail wrong. He said Zelenskyy “had just hosted” Macron, Starmer and Merz. However, the news reports said the leaders were on their way to meet Zelenskyy when the photos and videos were captured; they had not already met with him.', 'We asked digital forensic experts to analyse the close-up photo Jones posted that he alleged “clearly” showed a bag. Experts said they were unconvinced it was authentic.', 'V.S. Subrahmanian, a Northwestern University computer science professor, and Hany Farid, a University of California digital forensic expert, told PolitiFact that the image could have been modified using artificial intelligence, producing an image that may make the object look less like a tissue.', 'Darren Linvill, a Clemson University communication professor who studies Russian disinformation campaigns, said he saw the earliest mentions of this narrative in French on May 10.', 'At about 7:34 ET on May 11, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova posted images of the meeting on the messaging app Telegram; she’d added red circles around the white object on the table. Her caption said Macron, Starmer and Merz had forgotten “to put away their paraphernalia” before journalists arrived to take photos, according to a Guardian report and a Google Translate translation of her post from Russian to English. Her post also described Zelenskyy as an “unbalanced drug addict” who used cocaine in 2022.', 'Linvill said the false narrative proliferated across English social media – including X, Facebook and Reddit – on the morning of May 11. It was amplified and popularised by “accounts known to be part of the Russian Storm-1516 campaign distribution network”, he said.', 'Russian disinformation experts told PolitiFact it’s not uncommon for Russian influence campaigns to falsely accuse foreign leaders of illicit drug use, specifically involving cocaine.', '“Anything that makes the leaders of rival nations appear debauched and corrupt works to their advantage,” Linvill said. “Russia wants to undercut the legitimacy of Western democracy to make their own system appear better by comparison.”', 'Scott Radnitz, a University of Washington professor at the Jackson School of International Studies, said the cocaine claim tapped into “a long-running Kremlin narrative” that\\xa0Zelenskyy uses drugs.', 'A senior Russian official in 2024\\xa0called\\xa0Zelenskyy an “illegitimate drug addict” and accused him of trying to continue the Ukrainian war to preserve his power.', 'In 2022, PolitiFact also fact-checked a deceptively edited video that said it showed Zelenskyy saying he does cocaine. In the original video, Zelenskyy said he likes coffee and denied he uses cocaine. Such rumours date back to the 2019 Ukrainian presidential campaign, when Zelenskyy’s political rival challenged him to a drug test, which Zelenskyy took without any narcotics being detected. We found no credible news reports supporting claims that Zelenskyy uses drugs.', 'Radnitz said far-right online influencers like Jones often disseminate pro-Kremlin conspiracy theories. Some reports have said Jones’s website Infowars has republished more than 1,000 articles from a Russian state-sponsored outlet.', '“In this instance, the cocaine connection was broadened to also include world leaders in order to discredit an otherwise successful diplomatic engagement for Ukraine,” Radnitz said.', '*PolitiFact researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.*', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

The brothers have spent 35 years in prison after they were arrested for killing their parents with a shotgun in 1989.', 'So what happened to the brothers, and could they be freed?', 'On August 20, 1989, Lyle, then 21 and Erik, then 18, fired multiple shotgun rounds at their parents, Jose Menendez and Mary “Kitty” Louise, in their Beverly Hills mansion, killing them. The brothers were arrested in 1990.', 'The brothers’ lawyers said that they were driven to murder because Jose had sexually abused them for years, and Kitty had enabled this behaviour while emotionally abusing them. Prosecutors, however, had argued that the intent behind the murders was malicious and that the brothers wanted to inherit their parents’ multimillion-dollar fortune. Jose worked as a music and film executive and was also the head of the successful record label RCA, which had signed artists such as Duran Duran.', 'A 1994 trial resulted in a hung jury. In 1996, the brothers were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life without parole.', 'The case became fodder for American popular culture references, including in comedy dramas like Gilmore Girls and 30 Rock. A\\xa0 new generation of Americans were introduced to the case last year with the release of the nine-part Netflix biopic called Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, which tried to depict the murders and the circumstances leading up to them from both the parents’ and the brothers’ perspectives. A separate documentary on the case was also released a month after the Netflix show.', 'Public calls for their release from the general public, their family members, alongside celebrities including Kim Kardashian and Rosie O’Donnell, grew louder, and a TikTok movement sprang up after the release of the show and documentary.', 'Currently, the brothers are being held at the Richard J Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego, California.', 'The brothers were resentenced under California’s youthful offender statute. This applies to those who have committed a crime under the age of 26 and it immediately makes them eligible for parole once they serve half of their term.', 'The resentencing was one of three possible paths to freedom sought by the brothers. The other two included clemency granted by California Governor Gavin Newsom, who had ordered a parole board to assess whether the brothers would pose a danger to society; and a new trial, an option opposed by the office of Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman. The brothers’ lawyers filed a motion in May 2023, detailing new evidence and seeking a new trial.', 'Judge Michael Jesic of Los Angeles Superior Court resentenced the Menendez brothers. This decision came after a daylong hearing where their family members testified before the court in favour of the brothers’ release.', 'While Jesic said that their crime was “horrific,” he said it was “amazing” how the brothers had rehabilitated themselves in prison. “It’s something I’ve never seen before,” Jesic said.', 'Anamaria Baralt, 54, the brothers’ first cousin, told the court on Tuesday that the brothers were “universally forgiven” by both sides of the family. “They are different men from the boys that they were when they committed these crimes,” Baralt said.', 'Other family members said the brothers should receive credit for their rehabilitation while in prison. They cited Green Space, Lyle’s 2018 prison beautification project, alongside the role Erik played in providing hospice care to fellow inmates.', 'Now 57 and 54 years old, Lyle and Erik addressed the court on Tuesday through videolink from the prison in San Diego and took responsibility for their actions. “My crime was not just criminal. It was wrong. It was immoral. It was cruel and it was vicious,” Erik said. “Today, 35 years later, I am deeply ashamed of who I was,” said Lyle.', 'However, prosecutor Habib Balian said he was not convinced by the family members’ testimonies and argued that the court could not be confident that the brothers would not commit another violent crime. “We know … what they are capable of doing,” he said.', 'In recent years, new evidence has emerged that defence lawyers argue substantiates claims of the brothers enduring sexual abuse at the hands of Jose.', 'This includes a letter Erik wrote to his cousin, detailing his father’s sexual abuse when he was 17 years old.', 'Additionally, Roy Rossello, who was a boy band member in the 1980s, publicly revealed that Jose sexually assaulted him in a 2023 documentary series on Peacock. Rossello’s band was called Menudo and the documentary series is called Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed.', 'The emergence of new evidence was a trigger for the brothers to explore new avenues to secure their release.', 'While the brothers were initially sentenced, back in 1996, without the possibility of parole, their new sentence allows for parole. This means that they can be released before their sentence is over.', 'Before they can be freed, they have to make a case for why they should be released before the state parole board. The brothers will remain imprisoned until then, and it is now up to the state parole board and California Governor Newsom to decide their fate.', 'Lyle and Erik will appear on June 13 before the parole board for the risk assessment report that Newsom ordered to help his clemency decision. If the board does approve their release, Newsom needs to sign off on that.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

French and US officials have confirmed that at least one Rafale and one Russian-made jet were lost by India.', 'Indian officials have also confirmed to Al Jazeera that at least two planes crashed in Indian-administered territory, but did not clarify which country they belonged to.', 'With both India and Pakistan agreeing that neither side’s jets had crossed their frontier, the presence of debris from a crashed plane in Indian-administered territory suggests they were likely Indian, say analysts.', 'The ceasefire coming after that suggests a gain for Pakistan, Asfandyar Mir, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera. “Especially, the downing of the aircraft confirmed by various independent sources. So, it [Pakistan] may see the ceasefire as being better for consolidating that dividend.”', 'Muhammad Shoaib, an academic and security analyst at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad, called India’s strikes against Pakistan a strategic miscalculation. “Their reading of Pakistan’s ability to hit back was flawed,” he said.', 'Ladwig, however, said it would be a mistake to overstate the significance of any Pakistani successes, such as the possible downing of Indian jets. “These are, at best, symbolic victories. They do not represent a clear or unambiguous military gain,” he said.', 'In many ways, analysts say that the more meaty military accomplishment was India’s.', 'In addition to Kotli and Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, Indian missiles on May 7 also targeted four sites in Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous state and the country’s economic nerve-centre.', 'Over the next two days, India also fired drones that reached deep inside Pakistani territory, including major Pakistani population centres such as Lahore and Karachi.', 'And on May 10, Indian missiles hit three Pakistani airbases that were deeper in Pakistan’s Punjab than the Indian bases Pakistan hit that day were in Indian territory.', 'Simply put, India demonstrated greater reach than Pakistan did. It was the first time since the 1971 war between them that India had managed to hit Punjab.', 'Launching a military response not just across the Line of Control, the two countries’ de-facto border in Kashmir, but deep into Pakistan had been India’s primary goal, said Ramchandran. And India achieved it.', 'Ladwig, too, said that India’s success in targeting Punjab represented a serious breach of Pakistan’s defensive posture.', 'Military officials from both countries who spoke on Monday and agreed to hold the ceasefire also agreed to take immediate steps to reduce their troops’ presence along the borders. A second round of talks is expected within 48 hours.', 'However, later that day,Indian Prime Minister Modisaid that the fighting had merely “paused”.', 'Still, the Stimson Center’s Mir believes the ceasefire could hold.', '“Both sides face constraints and opportunities that have emerged during the course of the last week, which, on balance, make a ceasefire a better outcome for them,” he said.', 'Ladwig echoed that view, saying the truce reflects mutual interest in de-escalation, even if it does not resolve the tensions that led to the crisis.', '“India has significantly changed the rules of the game in this episode. The Indian government seems to have completely dispensed with the game that allows Islamabad and Rawalpindi to claim plausible deniability regarding anti-Indian terrorist groups,” he said.', '“What the Pakistani government and military do with groups on its soil would seem to be the key factor in determining how robust the ceasefire will be.”', 'Quaid-i-Azam University’s Shoaib, who is also a research fellow at George Mason University in the US, emphasised the importance of continued dialogue.', 'He warned that maintaining peace will depend on security dynamics in both Indian-administered Kashmir and Pakistan’s Balochistan province.', 'Just as India accuses Pakistan of supporting cross-border separatism, Islamabad alleges that New Delhi backs a separatist insurgency in Balochistan, a claim India denies.', '“Any subsequent bout of violence has the potential to get bloodier and more widespread,” Shoaib said. “Both sides, going for a war of attrition, could inflict significant damage on urban populations, without gaining anything from the conflict.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

The US initially designated Syria a “State Sponsor of Terrorism” in 1979, which led to an arms embargo and financial restrictions, including on foreign assistance.', 'Further sanctions were imposed in 2004, including more arms export restrictions and limits on Syria’s economic interactions with the US.', 'After the war in Syria began in 2011, and al-Assad’s regime started attacking civilian antigovernment protesters, numerous other wide-ranging sanctions were imposed on Syria and regime-linked individuals.

This was one of the reasons there has been international wariness to remove sanctions on Syria even after the fall of al-Assad.', 'Al-Sharaa has slowly been gaining international legitimacy for his government since it came to power in December. The US had already removed the reward for his capture, and the Syrian president has been able to travel internationally and meet world leaders, including in Saudi Arabia and France.', 'The new Syrian government has made a concerted effort to present itself as a moderate force that could be acceptable to the international community, including by distancing itself from designated “terrorist” groups, promising to cooperate with other countries on “counterterrorism” efforts and making statements supporting minority rights.

of dollars, but any mention of Israel was conspicuously absent from the announcements.', 'The so-called “normalisation” drive between Saudi Arabia and Israel dominated his predecessor,Joe Biden’s, approach to the region, but the current US president is shifting focus elsewhere, analysts say.', '“The Trump administration has made it clear they are willing to move forward on key agreements with Saudi Arabia without the previous condition of Saudi-Israel normalisation,” said Anna Jacobs, a non-resident fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute, a think tank.', '“This probably reflects growing frustration in the Trump administration with Israeli military action across the region, especially in Gaza.”', 'Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, fellow for the Middle East at the Baker Institute, also said that Trump has realised that with the ongoing war in Gaza and Israel’s refusal to negotiate the establishment of a Palestinian state, the “time is not right” for a Saudi Arabia-Israeli pact despite Biden’s emphasis on brokering a deal.', '“I think the White House has finally acknowledged that a normalisation agreement at this time is not possible,” Coates Ulrichsen told Al Jazeera.', 'During his first term, Trump managed to broker the Abraham Accords between Israel and several Arab countries, including the United Arab Emirates, which established formal relations with the US ally independently of the Palestinian issue.', 'However, the agreements were unsuccessful in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as evidenced by the outbreak of the war in Gaza in October 2023.', 'But even before the war started, Israel had been intensifying its militaryraids against Palestiniansand expanding illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank, further dimming the prospects of a two-state solution to the conflict.', 'Despite the agreements’ apparent shortcomings, Biden made adding Saudi Arabia to the Abraham Accords afocal pointof his Middle East agenda, and US officials said they worked on securing a deal up until the final days of the administration, even as the war on Gaza was raging.', 'Biden hasrepeatedly claimed, without evidence, that Hamas launched its October 7 attack against Israel in 2023 to thwart an agreement between the Saudis and Israelis.', 'Still, a day before he left office, Biden boasted that his Middle East policies created an opportunity for “thefuture of normalisationand integration of Israel with all its Arab neighbours, including Saudi Arabia”.', 'US officials and media reports said that Biden’s deal, which never materialised, would have brought a security pact between Riyadh and Washington and provided US help for Saudi Arabia to establish a civil nuclear programme in exchange for normalisation with Israel.', 'A major sticking point in that push has been the widely statedSaudi Arabian supportfor\\xa0the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, which conditions recognition of Israel on the establishment of a viable Palestinian state.', 'Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has categorically rejected the “land for peace” framework, pushing instead for deals with Arab countries thatbypass Palestinians.', '“This Israeli government won’t even provide lip service to the idea of a two-state solution, making it pretty impossible for Saudi Arabia to seriously consider moving forward with normalisation,” said Jacobs from the Arab Gulf States Institute.', '“The Trump administration seems to have understood that it’s off the table, at least for now.”', 'In Riyadh, Trump announced an agreement to deepen security cooperation with Saudi Arabia.', 'The$142bn dealwill provide Saudi Arabia with “state-of-the-art warfighting equipment and services” from US firms, the White House said.', 'It also includes “extensive training and support

continue, but expand, its devastating war on Gaza, which has killed more than 52,900 Palestinians, according to health authorities.', 'Khaled Elgindy, a visiting scholar at Georgetown University,

Gaza is probably one of the worst. If you go back to the Second World War – [there was] the carpet bombing of German cities, the firebombing of Japanese cities, for that matter, and, on a smaller scale, the bombing Britain experienced during the second and third years of the war.”', 'He added: “So, it’s not exceptional in that sense, but the concentration of so much firepower in a very small area is very unusual. It bears comparison with some of the worst examples of modern warfare and their impact on civilians.”', 'The World Health Organization (WHO) has documented the woes inflicted on Gaza’s healthcare sector, including the systematic destruction of hospitals, withholding of medical supplies and the detention of doctors.', '“Airstrikes and a lack of medical supplies, food, water and fuel have virtually depleted an already under-resourced health system,” the WHO said.', 'It added that 90 percent of housing units in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged.

New Delhi accused Islamabad of backing the gunmen. Pakistan denied its involvement.', 'India’s aerial assault kick-started four days of heightened tension, as both neighbours fired missiles and drones at each other’s military installations in a rapidly escalating cycle that brought them to the brink of full-scale war.', 'Both sides have claimed to have decisively damaged, even destroyed, the other’s key strategic facilities, even though early evidence suggests more limited damage to military bases in both India and Pakistan.', 'Yet even as India and Pakistan arrived at a ceasefire that United States President Donald Trump insists his administration brokered, experts say something has indeed been decimated, potentially beyond repair: Old red lines that had defined the tense relationship between the South Asian neighbours.', '“India and Pakistan have entered a phase of ‘armed coexistence’ with little room for diplomacy and a narrow margin for error, despite having a live and sensitive border,” Praveen Donthi, senior analyst at the International Crisis Group in New Delhi, told Al Jazeera.', '“This situation does not bode well for either country or the region, because even accidental triggers could escalate into a war-like situation with no guardrails in place.”', 'The seeds of the India-Pakistan conflict were sown when their independence from British rule in 1947 was accompanied by a partition of the Indian subcontinent to create Pakistan.', 'Since then, the two neighbours have fought four wars, three of them over Kashmir, a region they both control partially along with China, which governs two thin slices in the north. India claims all of Kashmir, while Pakistan claims all parts other than the ones governed by China, its ally.', 'After their 1971 war that led to the creation of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan signed what is known as the Simla Agreement, which said “the two countries are resolved to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations.”', 'While Pakistan has often cited United Nations resolutions to argue for international involvement in the resolution of the Kashmir dispute, India has cited the Simla Agreement for more than half a century to insist that any negotiations between the countries be strictly bilateral.', 'To be sure, the US has since intervened to calm tensions between India and Pakistan: In 1999, for instance, President Bill Clinton pressured Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to withdraw troops from the icy heights of Indian-controlled Kargil, where they had entered. However, Washington publicly played coy about its role, allowing India to insist that the US had only helped with crisis management, not any dispute resolution mediation.', 'That changed on Saturday, when US President Donald Trump upstaged New Delhi and Islamabad to announce a “full and immediate” India-Pakistan ceasefire hours before the governments of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi or his Pakistani counterpart Shehbaz Sharif confirmed the development.', 'The next day, Trump went further. “I will work with you, both to see if, after a ‘thousand years,’ a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir,” he posted on his Truth Social platform.', 'And on Monday, merely 30 minutes before Modi was scheduled for his first address since India launched attacks in Pakistan, Trump told reporters at the White House that his administration had leveraged trade to reach a ceasefire. “Let’s stop [the fighting]. If you stop it, we’ll do a trade. If you don’t stop it, we’re not going to do any trade,” Trump said. “And all of a sudden they said, ‘I think we’re going to stop.’ For a lot of reasons, but trade is a big one.”', 'Such US mediation, were it to happen, would shatter India’s longstanding red line against mediation by other countries, say experts.', '“India has consistently sought to avoid third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute even as it has occasionally welcomed third-party help in crisis management,” Christopher Clary, a former Pentagon official and a non-resident fellow at the Washington, DC-based Stimson Center, told Al Jazeera.', 'When he spoke, Modi largely stuck to traditional positions he has taken after previous bouts of tension with Pakistan. He said “terror and talks cannot happen together,” and “water and blood cannot flow together,” a reference to the Indus Waters Treaty for sharing water between India and Pakistan, which New Delhi walked out of after the Pahalgam attack.', 'Unlike Pakistan PM Sharif, who expressed gratitude to Trump for brokering a ceasefire, Modi claimed that India had “only paused” its military action – noting the decision was taken bilaterally. He did not mention Trump or his administration.', 'Regardless, “the spectre of international intervention” in Kashmir has been resurrected, said Sumantra Bose, political scientist and the author of the 2021 book Kashmir at the Crossroads. He said India’s furious barrage of missiles and drones at Pakistan in response to the Pahalgam killings “catered to domestic jingoism but naturally roused global alarm”.', 'India might, however, be helped in avoiding actual US intervention in Kashmir by the immediacy of the Trump administration’s other foreign policy goals, like the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, “that will divert already overburdened [American] policymakers to other tasks”, said Clary.', 'According to Bose, India and Pakistan crossed not just red lines, “but a Rubicon by attacking numerous high-population targets in cities and towns” last week.', 'India, in its most expansive offensive against Pakistan outside full-blown wars, said it hit “terrorist infrastructure” on May 7 as part of what it called Operation Sindoor. That was a reference to the vermillion that married Hindu women apply to their forehead, and an allusion to the manner in which the Pahalgam attack appears to have unfolded: Multiple witness accounts suggest the attackers segregated the men, then picked and hit non-Muslims.', 'Modi claimed, in his Monday statement, that the Indian attacks had killed more than 100 “terrorists”. Pakistan has insisted that only 31 civilians – including two children – were killed in the May attacks.', 'Yet both sides agree that the Indian missiles struck not just two cities – Muzaffarrabad and Kotli – in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, but also four cities in Pakistan’s Punjab province, the county’s economic heart and home to 60 percent of its population. The targets were Bahawalpur, Muridke, Shakar Garh and a village near Sialkot. This was the first time that India had struck Punjab since the 1971 war.', 'As tensions spiked, India accused Pakistan of unleashing a swarm of drones towards it – a charge Islamabad denied. Then India launched a wave of drones that reached Pakistan’s biggest population centres, including its two biggest cities, Karachi and Lahore. In the early hours of May 10, India and Pakistan fired missiles at each other’s military bases across multiple provinces – far beyond disputed Kashmir – even hitting a few.', 'Pakistan, which called its campaign Operation Bunyan Marsoos (a structure made of lead, in Arabic), targeted Indian air force bases and missile storage facilities in Drangyari, Udhampur, Uri and Nagrota (all in Indian-administered Kashmir), as well as in Pathankot, Beas and Adampur in Indian Punjab and Bhuj in Gujarat, Modi’s home state. Indian armed forces said that while they shot down most incoming missiles and drones, four air force bases suffered “limited damage”.', '“We don’t know what the quantum [of Indian losses] are, but clearly Pakistan has demonstrated capability to impose costs on India even as we try to impose costs on them,” Indian military historian and strategic analyst Srinath Raghavan told Al Jazeera.', '“Regarding red lines, another thing Pakistan sought to demonstrate was that they could\\xa0keep this [the fighting]\\xa0going till they had hit Indian military installations in retaliation.”', 'Meanwhile, India too targeted the Nur Khan airbase near Rawalpindi, Murid airbase in Chakwal and the Rafiqui airbase in Shorkot.', '“India has shown that it is willing and capable of carrying out more strikes across the border, whether it’s a terrorist or even military infrastructure in Pakistan,” Raghavan said. India’s response went far beyond what happened in 2019, when Indian jets bombed what they described as a “terrorist camp” in Balakot, in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, after a suicide bomber killed more than 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers.', 'Now, the 2025 attacks will serve as the new baseline for India, experts said.', '“India would respond [in the future] on a similar scale, perhaps even a little bit more. Given the way both Balakot and the current crisis have played out, that should be the expectation,” said Raghavan.', 'It isn’t just missiles and drones that the two sides fired at each other, though.', 'Right after the Pahalgam attack, India suspended its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty, a 1960 agreement that had previously survived three wars – in 1965, 1971 and 1999 – unscathed. The treaty gives India access to the waters of the three eastern rivers of the Indus basin: The Ravi, Beas and Sutlej. Pakistan, in turn, gets the waters of the three western rivers: The Indus, Jhelum and Chenab.', 'The river system is a vital lifeline for Pakistan, which relies on its waters. India, as the upper riparian state, has the ability – in theory at least – to restrict or stop the flow of the water into Pakistan. Islamabad described New Delhi’s decision to walk away from its obligations under the Indus Waters Treaty as an “act of war”.', 'In an incendiary remark at the peak of the tensions, Pakistani former Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto said “either the water will flow, or their blood will,” seemingly referring to Indians.', 'Three days after the ceasefire was announced, India has still not recommitted itself to the pact. In his speech on Monday evening, Modi’s statement that “blood and water cannot flow together” signalled that New Delhi had not yet decided to return to the treaty.', 'Even as India and Pakistan ratcheted up their measures – first diplomatically, then militarily – against each other, the rest of the world was spooked by the prospect of what could have turned into a full-blown war between nuclear-armed neighbours.', 'Up until now, that reality of nuclear weapons has affected India’s decisions in terms of how it treats its tensions with Pakistan, said Clary, the former Pentagon official. “India’s goal is to punish Pakistan without risking nuclear danger,” he said.', 'But on Monday, Modi appeared to suggest that New Delhi was reassessing that approach. “India will not tolerate any nuclear blackmail. India will strike precisely and decisively at the terrorist hideouts developing under the cover of nuclear blackmail,” he said.', 'Modi’s comments pointed to a “fundamental shift that has occurred in relations between India and Pakistan”, Donthi, the International Crisis Group analyst, said. “Both sides are willing to take greater risks and explore the potential for escalation below the nuclear threshold. However, there is very little space there, effectively making the euphemism of the region being a nuclear flashpoint truer than ever.”', 'Modi’s comments on “nuclear blackmail” weren’t the only ones that marked a break from the past.', 'When India launched attacks against Pakistan on May 7, it emphasised that it was only targeting “terrorist” bases and not attacking Pakistani military installations. However, on Monday, Modi said that in future, “India will not differentiate between the government sponsoring terrorism and the masterminds of terrorism.”', 'That position raises the danger of war, said experts.', '“The conflation of terrorists and their (alleged) backers – namely, the military and the government – portends serious risks,” Donthi said. “It assumes that they are in lockstep. Such an assumption doesn’t take into account facts such as the seemingly successful ceasefire.”', 'India and Pakistan had signed a ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in 2003 and had renewed it in 2021. Despite cross-border firing along the LoC, the ceasefire had largely held until last week.', 'With the threshold for a military conflict lowered, “the situation has become precarious,” Donthi said.', '“A single militant attack is all it takes to plunge into war, leaving no room for diplomacy and raising no questions. Any power hostile to either or both sides can exploit this.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

They could concede de facto control, but Trump didn’t seem to take that distinction,” Clarke said.', '“He’s shaken things up, but I think he’s been obviously far too credulous to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and to Russia in the whole process.”', 'Clarke spoke to Al Jazeera on the sidelines of the 16th Conference on Baltic Studies in Europe, hosted recently by Cambridge University’s Centre for Geopolitics, which Clarke co-directs with Brendan Simms, a professor of European geopolitics.', 'The prospect of a possible ceasefire is rarely out of the headlines.', 'Over the weekend, Putin said Russia would engage in direct talks with Ukraine “without preconditions” – a rare offer throughout the conflict – after European leadersmetZelenskyy in Kyiv to call for a 30-day truce.', 'Ukraine and Europe have presented a ceasefire document, which, unlike Trump’s plan, makes no territorial concessions to Russia three years after it invaded Ukraine. The question is whether they are willing and able to back it with continued military effort if Russia and the US reject it.', '“The scenario of a complete American withdrawal may be overly bleak right now, but it’s definitely a possibility,” said Simms.', 'Should Europe then offer Ukraine an independent security guarantee?', '“I do think we should do that, but I think we should only do it if we are genuinely committed to going the full mile with Ukraine,” said Simms.', '“I could quite easily see, for instance, a discourse in a country like Germany, which would say something like, ‘Well, it’s awful what’s happening in Ukraine, Trump is awful, [but] no we’re not going to do anything to help Ukraine, and we are going to use Trump as an excuse to walk away from supporting Ukraine’,” Simms said. “That is very much a discourse you’re beginning to hear in German public opinion.”', 'Both Clarke and Simms believed the Russian army’s ability to win an uncontestable military victory in Ukraine has been overestimated thanks to narratives touted by the Kremlin.', '“There’s beenfar too much beliefthat the Russians have got an effective military and economic machine,” said Clarke, citing the Russian failure to take Kyiv in 2022 and losing control of the Black Sea to an adversary without a navy.', 'Russia’s territorial gains in Ukraine have slowed down dramatically, two separate analyses found last month.', 'The Ministry of Defence of the United Kingdom estimated that Russian forces seized 143sq km (55sq miles) of Ukrainian land in March, compared with 196sq km (75sq miles) in February and 326sq km (125sq miles) in January.', 'The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington, DC-based think tank, spotted the same trend, estimating Russian gains of 203sq km (78sq miles) in March, 354sq km (136sq miles) in February and 427sq km (165sq miles) in January.', 'This pattern of diminishing returns had started in 2024, a year when Russia wrested away just 4,168sq km (1,610sq miles) of fields and abandoned villages – equivalent to 0.69 percent of Ukraine, the ISW determined in January.', 'Those meagre gains came at the cost of 430,790 soldiers, the equivalent of 36 Russian motorised rifle divisions, outnumbering Russia’s losses in 2022 and 2023 combined, said Ukraine’sMinistry ofDefence.', 'As Russia prepared to celebrate the 80th anniversary of victory in World War II, its losses in Ukraine were approaching the one million mark, Ukraine’s Defence Ministry said.', 'Al Jazeera is unable to independently verify casualty tolls.', '“They do have weight of numbers on their side, but weight of numbers only counts if you’ve got willing fighters,” said Clarke. “And there’s a great deal of evidence that there’s real problems for the Russian leadership in terms of the attitude of Russian troops and Russian positions.”', 'While Europe could ultimately step up defence industrial capacity, Clarke cautioned that Europe would nonetheless struggle to replace US intelligence, political coherence and command and control.', 'These issues have recently come to the fore, as Europe grappled with the possibility of fielding a peacekeeping ground force in Ukraine.', 'Simms argued in favour of creating it, but against deploying it in Ukraine as a peacekeeping force.', 'One reason is that European militaries are not trained for the drone warfare now being developed in Ukraine and will not be effective, he said.', '“The other consideration is that the Ukrainian army is our most effective ally.

But experts say $2.1 trillion may not fully happen.', 'Since returning to the White House, US President Donald Trump has touted corporate andforeign US investmentannouncements as proof he is ushering in “the golden age of America”.', 'On January 21, Trump said that before he’d finished the “first full business day” of his second term, the United States had “already secured nearly $3 trillion of new investments”.', 'On April 2, he said, “It looks like we’re going to have about $6 trillion of investments”. Six days later, Trump told National Republican Congressional Committee Dinner attendees that the investment total was “now revised up to about $7 (trillion)”.', 'During an April 30 NewsNation town hall, Trump speculated that “it could be more than $8 trillion”.', 'On May 4, Trump told Kristen Welker, the host of the NBC News programme Meet the Press, “I think we probably have close to $9 trillion of investments coming into this country.”', 'On May 6, Trump told reporters, “I think the real number could be $9 or $10 trillion.”', 'Finally, on May 8,\\xa0Trump said, “We have now close to $10 trillion — think of that, $10 trillion” in investments. “We’re talking about essentially two months.”', 'That’s far beyond the figures the White House has released publicly.', 'We tallied the White House’s public lists of investments; they amount to $2.1 trillion in corporate investments, or at most $5.1 trillion when including promised investments from other countries. Experts cautioned that the promised corporate investments are not guaranteed to materialise in full, or during Trump’s presidency, and some of them would have occurred regardless of who was president.', 'Trump isn’t the first to overstate new investments on his watch. Outgoing US President Joe Biden said in 2024 that his bipartisanCHIPS and Science Acthad attracted $640bn in private investments; economists told PolitiFact that Biden’s numbers were based on what companies had announced, which is not the same as dollars already spent.', 'Roman V Yampolskiy, a University of Louisville professor and a specialist in artificial intelligence, which dominates the promised investments Trump cited, said, “Historically, large-scale investment announcements often overpromise and underdeliver. There is a performative element to them, especially in politically charged contexts. They function as political theatre as much as economic commitment.”', 'SinceTrump’s inauguration, the White House has publicised investment announcements from three countries and roughly 60 companies on its website, including in a “non-comprehensive running list”. Many of the highest-dollar corporate announcements were in March and April.', 'Corporate announcements in the White House’s lists total approximately $2.1 trillion worth of US investment.', 'The White House separately has cited commitments from the United Arab Emirates to invest $1.4 trillion over the next 10 years; from Japan to “boost” its investment in the US to $1 trillion; and from Saudi Arabia to invest $600bn in the US during Trump’s presidency. Combined with the corporate announcements, these bring the total to about $5.1 trillion, $4.9 trillion short of Trump’s figure.', 'But the $5.1 trillion total has caveats. For example, the White House said “Japan announced a $1 trillion investment in the US”, but the article it linked said in 2023, Japan’s US investment was $783.3bn and Japan would “boost” that to $1 trillion. That’s an increase of $216.7bn rather than a new $1 trillion investment. That would put the total value of newly pledged US investment at about $4.3 trillion.', 'The White House figures can’t easily be used for apples-to-apples comparisons. Some of the investments are planned over Trump’s four-year term, others over five years or a decade. In one case – ADQ and Energy Capital Partners’ planned $25bn investment — it isn’t limited to US-based projects.', 'The White House declined to detail additional investments. A spokesperson pointed to federal Bureau of Economic Analysis data that shows a 22 percent increase in business investment in the first quarter of 2025, calling it a historic increase.', 'However, experts\\xa0cautioned\\xa0this increase was shaped bybusinessesstocking up on inventory beforeTrump’s tariffstake effect and said the increase is unlikely to be sustained.', 'Experts told PolitiFact that each of the five biggest investments on Trump’s list warrants some caution, because they might not reach Trump’s cited dollar amounts or were not solely prompted by Trump’s policies.', '“Many of these announcements, particularly those in the AI and semiconductor sectors, appear to be, at least in part, aspirational in nature,” Yampolskiy said. “They serve a signalling function: to attract investor attention, shape policy discourse, and secure favourable regulatory or funding environments.”', 'The five largest company investments collectively account for 82 percent of the dollar value on the White House’s corporate list.', 'The Stargate Project is an artificial intelligence collaboration among OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank, announced during a January 21 White House event. The White House values the investment at $500bn.', 'The company’sofficial announcementsays $100bn will be invested “immediately” and that it “intends to invest” a total of $500bn over the next four years, a goal repeated by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son at the White House event.', '“Whether that much will ultimately get spent remains to be seen,”\\xa0wrote\\xa0John Higgins, chief economist at Capital Economics, an international consulting firm.', 'Enrique Dans, who studies technology and policy at Madrid’s IE Business School, said the $500bn figure is “astronomical – roughly 2 percent of US gross domestic product – and lacks clear documentation”.', 'At the White House event, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, “We wouldn’t be able to do this without you, Mr President.” But Altman had been discussing plans for a $100bn investment 10 months before Trump won his second term, The Washington Post reported, including an Abilene, Texas, data centre that began construction in summer 2024.', '“AI investmentshave been on a global trajectory driven by technological maturity and competitive pressure, especially from China,” Dans said. “Any US president would have seen a surge.”', 'Nvidia Corp, another AI company, said itplansto invest up to $500bn in US infrastructure over the next four years. Previously, Nvidiamanufacturedmost of its chips in Taiwan.', '“It is unlikely Nvidia would have moved any production to the US if it was not for pressure from the Trump administration,” Gil Luria, an analyst with the financial services firm D.A. Davidson, told Reuters. However, Luria added, “The half a trillion number is likely hyperbole.”', 'Dans said that although tax cuts from Trump’s first term have benefited the company’s focus on US-based efforts, “the core growth likely would have occurred anyway”, regardless of the president.', 'On February 24, days after Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, met with Trump, the consumer electronics giantannouncedit plans to spend “more than $500bn in the US over the next four years.”', 'Analysts have expressed scepticism that this represents new investment. Dans called the investment “simply more of what [Apple] already does,” from “day-to-day activities with thousands of suppliers in all 50 states to the operation of its domestic data centres, as well as its investments in Apple TV+ and other projects already manufactured in the country.”', 'In a note to investors, David Vogt, an analyst with the Swiss-based bank UBS, wrote, “Call us a sceptic. … We believe [the figure] lacks substance.”', 'IBM announced April 28 plans to invest $150bn in the US, including more than $30bn in research and development on US-based manufacturing of mainframe and quantum computers.', 'This is “not clearly Trump-related,” Dans said. “IBM’s strategy pivots have been under way since the 2010s.”', 'Luria said, “While we believe IBM will continue to invest in the emerging area of quantum technology, the bombastic figure is more likely a gesture towards the US administration,” Reuters reported.', 'Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, which makes semiconductors for computing and electronics, haspledged to spend $100bnin the US. Analysts said this number is the most well-supported among the investments that Trump cites. Although bringing semiconductor production back to the US began during Trump’s first term, it was “greatly accelerated by” Biden’s CHIPS and Science Act, which prompted years of investment before Trump’s second term, Dans said.', 'Over the past five years, the company has spent at least $65bn on fabrication facilities near Phoenix, Arizona, funded in part by $6.6bn from the CHIPS and Science Act.', 'Overall, Dans said, “Trump might deserve some partial credit for setting a more aggressive tone on economic nationalism and supply chain reshoring, and for lowering the corporate tax reform, which did affect repatriation and some investment decisions. But most of these trends — the AI boom, the semiconductor reshoring, the cloud computing infrastructure — are long-term structural shifts that predate Trump and will continue regardless of who is in office.”', 'Trump said, “We have now close to $10 trillion, think of that, $10 trillion” in investments. “We’re talking about essentially two months.”', 'The White House has pointed to investment announcements totalling $5.1 trillion, including $2.1 trillion from companies and the rest from countries.', 'That’s at least $4.9 trillion short of Trump’s figure, and these announcements representfuture spending, some of which is planned over four years, five years or a decade.', 'Experts said many of the dollar amounts are aspirational and that the investments announced might never be fully reached.

I don’t know.”', 'Days later, while announcing that the 2027 NFL (National Football League) draft will be in Washington, DC, Trump said, “The courts have, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, they said, maybe you have to have trials. Trials. We’re gonna have five million trials? Doesn’t work … Past presidents took out hundreds of thousands of people when needed … They didn’t go through any of this.”', 'Despite Trump’s dismissal of and questions about due process for immigrants, the US Constitution, legal experts and decades of court decisions agree: immigrants, regardless of how they entered the US, legally or illegally, have due process rights.', 'What those rights look like varies depending on how long a person has been in the US and what their legal status is.', 'Due process generally refers to the government’s requirement to follow fair procedures and laws. The Constitution’s Fifth andFourteenthAmendments protect “any person” against being deprived by the US government of “life, liberty, or property, without due process of law”.', '“People have a right to be heard, and there are certain steps that need to be taken before someone can, say, be jailed,” Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a lawyer and policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, said.', 'Several\\xa0court\\xa0rulings\\xa0have\\xa0determined that due process rights are extended to all people in the US, not just US citizens or immigrants in the country legally. The US Constitution and the Immigration and Nationality Act dictate the process the government must use to afford immigrants due process rights.', 'In immigration, due process generally refers to “appropriate notice [of government action], the opportunity to have a hearing or some sort of screening interview to figure out, are you actually a person who falls within the law that says that you can be deported”, Katherine Yon Ebright, a lawyer at the Brennan Centre for Justice’s Liberty and National Security programme, said.', 'For example, if the government seeks to deport people who are undocumented, the government generally must give them a charging document known as a “notice to appear”. Eventually, immigrants go before an immigration judge to present evidence and make a case that they qualify for some form of relief against deportation, such as asylum.', 'Without due process, legal experts say, US citizens could also be deported.', '“The whole point of due process is to determine whether you’re the kind of person who can be subject to deportation,” Ilya Somin, a George Mason University constitutional law professor, said. “If there is no due process, then the government can simply deport people or punish them at will … Because how can you show that you’re actually a US citizen if you’re not getting any due process?”', 'Even though all people in the US have due process rights, for noncitizens, the specifics of the process and the extent of protections vary. The term noncitizen applies to people with legal documents as well as those without any documents, including people here on visas, with lawful permanent status or without a legal immigration status.', 'There is a “sliding scale of different protections that people can have depending on what their [immigration] status is”, Yon Ebright said.', 'Noncitizens are not entitled to government-appointed lawyers during immigration proceedings, for example. And some immigrants who recently entered the US without a legal document do not have to appear before a judge before being deported; these cases are subject to what is called the expedited removal process.', 'Under expedited removal, certain people can be quickly deported without a court case. However, people who express fear of persecution if they return to their home countries are referred to immigration officers, who determine whether the immigrant is eligible for asylum or other deportation protections. Immigrants who pass the “credible fear” screening are referred to an immigration court where they can present their case.', 'In the past, people were placed in expedited removal if they were within 100 miles (about 161km) of the border and within two weeks of their entry. In January, Trump expanded expedited removal for anyone who cannot prove they have been in the US for more than two years.', 'TheAlien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime power that Trumpinvokedin March, allows the government to deport “alien enemies”. He has used that law to deport people his administration says are members of the Venezuelan prison gangTren de Aragua, without immigration court hearings. The Trump administration has deported hundreds of people under the law.', 'However, the US Supreme Courtruledagainst the administration on April 7, saying it must give immigrants notice that they will be deported under the Alien Enemies Act, and give them “reasonable time” to challenge the deportation in court.', 'Although expedited removal and the Alien Enemies Act limit people’s due process protections, they do not eliminate them. “There are no exceptions to due process,” Bush-Joseph said.', 'Additionally, noncitizens who are charged with crimes receive the same due process protections as US citizens in criminal court, Somin said.', '“All of the protections of the Bill of Rights apply [in criminal court],” Somin said. “There has to be proof beyond a reasonable doubt. He or she is entitled to a jury trial, rights against self-incrimination, right to counsel and so on.”', 'The Trump administration faces\\xa0several\\xa0court\\xa0cases\\xa0dealing with deportations and immigrants’ due process rights. They include challenges over Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act and the government’smistaken deportationof a Salvadoran man.', 'Administration\\xa0officials\\xa0have\\xa0criticised\\xa0judges and\\xa0rejected\\xa0immigrants’ due process protections.', '“Due process guarantees the rights of a criminal defendant facing prosecution, not an illegal alien facing deportation,” White House adviser Stephen Miller posted on X on\\xa0May 5.', 'The Trump administration’s comments about due process are centred on his promise to carry out the largest deportation operation in US history. The administration’s current deportation pace is below its goal of one million people each year, the Migration Policy Institute said in an April 24 analysis.', 'Nayna Gupta, policy director of the immigrant rights advocacy group American Immigration Council, said the Trump administration is attempting to “get around those obstacles and those requirements” of due process “just to meet some target [deportation] number”.', 'To reach Trump’s goal of one million deportations annually, the administration would need todeport peoplewho have lived in the US\\xa0 for years and have no criminal convictions (whom past administrations have not prioritised for deportation).', 'Past presidents were also required to uphold noncitizens’ due process rights, but deportation processes moved more quickly under administrations that focused on people who had recently crossed the border illegally, Bush-Joseph said. That option is more limited for the Trump administration because undocumented immigration has reached historic lows under Trump.', 'Trump is correct that deporting millions of people living in the US without legal documents would require millions of court cases, Tara Watson, director of the Centre for Economic Security and Opportunity at the Brookings Institution, said. That has long been the case.', 'Millions of immigration court cases are\\xa0backlogged. And the Trump administration hasfiredseveral immigration judges who would hear these cases.', 'The administration’s goal for mass deportation does not change due process rules and standards.', '“It is true that due process slows down the machinery of deportation, but due process is also what separates democracies from dictatorships,” Watson said.', 'Trump said, “If people come into our country without documents, there’s a different standard [for due process].”', 'All people in the US, regardless of their immigration status, have due process rights, based on the US Constitution and decades of court decisions. That applies whether they entered the US legally or without any documents.', 'For noncitizens, people’s due process protections vary based on their legal status or how long they have been in the US.

Why be apart when we can at least die together?” she urged her younger son, who studies at a university in New Delhi, the national capital.', 'Shah, 23, said her appeal shattered him. An hour or so later, another news flash popped up on his phone: “US President Donald Trump says India and Pakistan have agreed to a ‘full and immediate’ ceasefire.” Moments later, the South Asian rivalsconfirmed the ceasefire, mediated by dozens of countries besides the United States.', '“It was such a relief,” Shah recalled. Happily, he called home. “Both countries have agreed to peace. We will spend more time soon, don’t be afraid, mother,” he told 48-year-old Bano, who asked him to focus on his studies and return home only after his annual exams.', 'However, barely three hours after that phone call, the sense of relief was blown away.

And the question is who he blames for the failure. If he blames the Russians more, then full US aid will continue to Ukraine and the sanctions he has threatened will be intensified,” Lieven said.', '“If, however, he blames Ukraine more, then, as he’s done once before, he will suspend US aid and intelligence assistance to Ukraine, and that, of course, will drastically weaken Ukraine’s military position and strengthen that of Russia. So both sides are manoeuvring to try to throw blame for any failure onto the other.”', 'Former US President Joe Biden, Western European leaders and Ukraine portray the invasion as an imperial-style land grab and have repeatedly pledged to defeat Russian forces.', 'Putin, meanwhile, casts the war as a watershed moment in Moscow’s relations with the West, which he says humiliated Russia after the Soviet Union fell in 1991 by enlarging NATO and encroaching on what he considers Moscow’s sphere of influence, including Ukraine.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

Despite intense military exchanges, including missile strikes, drone attacks, and artillery shelling, neither government made an official declaration of war.', 'India and Pakistan instead characterised their military actions as specific coordinated “military operations”.', 'Pakistan on Saturday launched a retaliatory assault it named “Bunyan Marsoos”, Arabic for “Wall of Lead”, just days after India initiated “Operation Sindoor“, responding to adeadly attack on touristsin Pahalgam on April 22, which it blamed on Pakistan-based armed groups.', 'However, that is not unusual for these two countries. They have not officially declared war inprevious major conflicts, even as thousands of soldiers and civilians died.', 'Yes. Third-party mediationhas resolved disputessince 1947, when the subcontinent split through partition and India and Pakistan fought their first war. After a yearlong war over ownership of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, a United Nations-brokered ceasefire effectively split Kashmir between Indian- and Pakistan-administered regions in 1948.', 'The 1965 Indo-Pakistani War ended with the Tashkent Declaration in January 1966, following mediation by the erstwhile Soviet Union. The accord saw Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistani President Ayub Khan agree to pull back to pre-war positions and restore diplomatic and economic ties.', 'During the 1999Kargil War, Pakistani troops crossed the LoC and seized Indian positions. Then-US President Bill Clinton convinced Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to withdraw, warning of international isolation.', 'In 2002, then-US Secretary of State Colin Powell claimed he and his team had mediated the end of a tense stand-off along the LoC following an attack on the Indian Parliament in December 2001. The following June, Powell said that through negotiations, he had received assurances from President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan that “infiltration activity” across the LoC would cease and that armed groups would be dismantled on Pakistani territory.', 'There is no single definition. International humanitarian law, such as the Geneva Conventions, uses the term “international armed conflict” instead of “war”, defining it more broadly as any use of armed forces between states, regardless of whether either side calls it a “war”.', 'In modern international law, all uses of force are categorised as “armed conflict” regardless of justifications such as self-defence, according to Ahmer Bilal Soofi, an advocate in the Supreme Court of Pakistan who also specialises in international law.', 'The suspension of a treaty can also signal the start of war, he added. India suspended its participation in the landmark Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan on April 23, a move Pakistan described as a “hostile act”.', '“Political scientists normally say a war only exists after fighting becomes quite intense – normally 1,000 battle deaths,” said Christopher Clary, assistant professor of political science at the University at Albany. “For governments, though, wars exist whenever they say so.”', 'Experts argue the recent escalation in military actions by India and Pakistan was as much about signalling strength as they were about military objectives, and was also part of a broader effort to manage domestic and international perception.', 'Sean Bell, a United Kingdom-based military analyst, said much of the current rhetoric from both India and Pakistan is deliberately aimed at domestic audiences. Each side is “trying to make clear to their own populations that there is a robust military response, and that they’re retaliating for any actions”, he told Al Jazeera. But this tit-for-tat dynamic, Bell warned, risks becoming difficult to stop once it starts.', 'Following the adoption of the UN Charter in 1945, “no country claims ‘war’ or declares ‘war’ as, legally speaking, it is viewed as unlawful use of force”, Soofi told Al Jazeera.', 'Officially, being in a state of armed conflict triggers international legal obligations, such as following the rules of armed conflict and being accountable for war crimes.', 'In the latest India-Pakistan standoff, both sides portrayed the other as the aggressor, insisting it should be the one to de-escalate.', 'The absence of a formal, universally accepted definition of war means countries can engage in sustained military operations without ever officially declaring war. Ambiguity also allows governments to frame military actions in ways that suit their political or diplomatic goals.', 'For example, Russia has consistently described its 2022 invasion of Ukraine as a “special military operation”, despite large-scale troop deployments, air strikes and territorial occupation. Similarly, the US referred to the Korean War in the 1950s as a “police action” and framed its long-term activities in Afghanistan and Iraq as “counterterrorism operations”. Israel also often uses terms like “military campaign” or “operation” for cross-border offensives, such as “Operation Protective Edge” during its 2014 war in Gaza.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

However, in mid-March, the Israeli national broadcaster, Kan, ran a report disputing official numbers, which claimed that more than 80 percent of those called up for duty had attended, suggesting that the actual figure was closer to 60 percent.', '“There has been a steady increase in refusal among reservists,” a spokesperson for the organisation New Profile, which supports people refusing enlistment, said. “However, we often see sharp spikes in response to specific shifts in Israeli government policy, such as the violation of the most recent ceasefire or public statements by officials indicating that the primary objective of the military campaign is no longer the return of hostages and ‘destruction of Hamas’, as initially claimed, but rather the occupation of Gaza, and its ethnic cleansing.”', 'Also unaddressed is growing public discontent over the ultra-religious Haredi community, whose eight-decade exemption frommilitary service was deemed illegalby the Supreme Court in June of last year.', 'Despite the shortfall in reservists reporting for duty and others having experienced repeated deployments, in April, the Supreme Court requested an explanation from Netanyahu – who relies upon Haredi support to maintain his coalition – as to why its ruling had not been fully implemented or enforced.', 'Throughout the war, Netanyahu’s escalations, while often resisted by the captives’ families and their allies, have been cheered on and encouraged by his allies among the far-right, many of whom claim a biblical right to the homes and land of Palestinians.', 'The apparent conflict between the welfare of the captives and the “total victory” promised by Netanyahu has run almost as long as the conflict itself, with each moment of division seemingly strengthening the prime minister’s position through the critical support of the ultranationalist elements of his cabinet.', 'Netanyahu’s position has led to conflict with politicians, including his own former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. While Gallant wasn’t opposed to the war in principle – his active support for Netanyahu eventually led to him joining Netanyahu in facing an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for war crimes – his prioritisation of the captives put him at odds with the prime minister.', 'The divide over priorities has meant that civility between the government and the captives’ families has increasingly gone out the window, with Netanyahu generally avoiding meeting families with loved ones still captive in Gaza, and far-right politicians engaging in shouting matches with them during meetings in parliament.', 'Division within Israeli society was not new, Professor Yossi Mekelberg of Chatham House told Al Jazeera, “but wars and conflicts deepen them”.', '“Now we have a situation where some people have served anywhere up to 400 days in the army [as reservists], while others are refusing to serve at all and exploiting their political power within the coalition to do so,” Mekelberg added.', '“Elsewhere, there are ministers on the extreme right talking about ‘sacrificing’ the hostages for military gain,” something Mekelberg said many regarded as running counter to much of the founding principles of the country and the Jewish faith.', '“There’s such toxicity in public discourse,” Mekelberg continued, “We see toxicity against anyone who criticises the war or the prime minister, division between the secular and the religious, and then even divisions within the religious movements.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

India has not yet responded either to Pakistan’s claims that Indian bases were hit or to Islamabad’s allegation that New Delhi launched missiles at its military installations.', 'India first conducted nuclear tests in May 1974 before subsequent tests in May 1998, after which it declared itself a nuclear weapons state.

But he began his tenure as head with a stark warning for the agency.', '“I — and I alone in FEMA — speak for FEMA. I’m here to carry out the president’s intent for FEMA,” he reportedly told staff in an agency-wide call.', 'He predicted that 20 percent of the staff would oppose Trump’s vision for the FEMA, which he has pledged to dismantle.', '“Obfuscation, delay, undermining. If you’re one of those 20 percent of people and you think those tactics and techniques are going to help you, they will not, because I will run right over you,” Richardson said.', '“Don’t get in my way,” he added. “I know all the tricks.”', 'FEMA is the agency charged with coordinating and carrying out the federal government’s response to natural disasters and other emergencies, ranging from hurricanes and flooding to domestic attacks.', 'But it has long been criticised for lagging response times, inadequate resources and disorganisation, particularly during major disasters like2005’s Hurricane Katrina, which displaced tens of thousands of residents in Louisiana and killed more than 1,300 people.', 'Trump has responded to such criticisms by pledging to do away with FEMA altogether and redistributing its functions to individual states.', '“\\u200aWhen there’s a problem with the state, I think that that problem should be taken care of by the state,” Trumpsaid in January. “That’s what we have states for. They take care of problems. And a governor can handle something very quickly, you know?”', 'During his campaign for re-election in 2024, he also spread falsehoods about the agency, including that it had refused to offer relief to Republican residents in North Carolina, which had recently suffered widespread flooding from Hurricane Helene.', 'Since taking office in January, Trump has followed through with his plans to restructure the federal government, reducing the funding and staff to independent entities like theUnited States Agency for International Development(USAID) and theConsumer Financial Protection Bureau(CFPB).', 'Trump and his allies have framed the cuts as necessary to combat “fraud” and “waste” across the government, though he has not offered definitive proof of wrongdoing.', 'At FEMA, an estimated 2,000 employees were terminated or accepted buyout offers to resign. A 2023 Government Accountability Office report indicated that FEMA only had 5,000 full-time staff members, as well as a group of reservists and emergency-response workers who could be called up to address a crisis.', 'To become the administrator of FEMA requires undergoing a Senate confirmation hearing and a vote.', 'But while those Senate hearings continue for high-level government positions, Trump has named interim leaders to govern the organisation in the meantime.', 'Cameron Hamilton, a former Navy SEAL, served in that role since Trump started his second term.', 'He had been a prominent critic of FEMA during the administration of former President Joe Biden. But his time as FEMA chief came to an abrupt halt earlier this week, in the wake of an appearance before an appropriations subcommittee in the House of Representatives.', 'At Wednesday’s hearing, a Democratic Representative, Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, asked Hamilton about the idea that FEMA could be shuttered.', 'Hamilton responded with measured opposition. “I do not believe it is in the best interest of the American people to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency,” he said.', 'He added that it was ultimately not his decision to make and criticised FEMA as part of an “overextended federal bureaucracy”.', '“I’m not in a position to make decisions and impact outcomes on whether or not a determination such as consequential as that should be made. That is a conversation that should be had between the president of the United States and this governing body,” Hamilton told the committee.', 'But the very next day, Hamilton was removed from his role as FEMA’s interim head and replaced by Richardson, a Marine veteran.', 'On Friday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Hamilton’s removal was related to his testimony at the subcommittee hearing.', '“My understanding is that this individual testified saying something that was contrary to what the President believes and the goals of this administration in regards to FEMA policy,” Leavitt said. “And so, of course, we want to make sure that people in every position are advancing the administration’s goals.”', 'Critics, including Representative DeLauro, blasted the switch-up as indicative of a White House that will not tolerate dissent, even when necessary.', '“The Trump administration must explain why [Hamilton] has been removed from this position,” DeLauro said in a statement. “Integrity and morality should not cost you your job.”', 'Richardson, meanwhile, has proceeded to set a stricter tone for his tenure, with his fiery Friday phone call. He warned FEMA staff that any actions not “within our missions” would be considered a waste of taxpayer funds.', '“We’re going to find out how to do things better. We’re going to find out how to push things down to the states that should be done at state level. Also we’re going to find out how we can do more cost-sharing with the states,” he said.', 'Trump has been criticised for denying requests for assistance, including from Republican-led states like Arkansas, which suffered tornadoes during the week of March 14, destroying neighbourhoods. Multiple deaths were reported.', 'Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders — who worked as Trump’spress secretaryduring his first term — has written to the president to appeal his denial of aid.', '“Since 2023, Arkansas has experienced an unprecedented frequency of disasters, with four federally declared disasters and ten state-declared disasters. These overlapping events have severely strained the capacity of state and local agencies to respond and recover effectively,” Huckabee Sanders wrote.', '“Many Arkansans are still living in temporary conditions or repairing damages from previous events, only to be displaced or impacted once again. The state and its citizens are in dire need of assistance to recover, rebuild, and mitigate further loss.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

It condemned the attack in April and called for an independent investigation.', 'Here is more about who the armed groups are and the major attacks they’ve claimed or been blamed for.', 'The TRF emerged in 2019 following the Indian government’s suspension ofArticle 370 of the Indian Constitution,stripping Indian-administered Kashmir of itssemi-autonomous status.', 'However, the group was not widely known before the Pahalgam attack, which it took responsibility for in April via the Telegram messaging app, on which it said it was opposed to the granting of residency permits to “outsiders”.', 'Since the repeal of Article 370, non-Kashmiris have been granted residency permits to settle in Indian-administered Kashmir. This has stoked fears that the Indian government is trying to change the demographics of Kashmir, whose population is nearly all Muslim.', 'Unlike other armed rebel groups in Kashmir, the TRF does not have an Islamic name.', 'However, the Indian government maintains that it is an offshoot of, or a front for, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a Pakistan-based armed group whose name means “Army of the Pure”.', 'In 2020, TRF started claiming responsibility for minor attacks, including some targeted killings. TRF recruits included rebels from different splinter rebel groups. Indian security agents say they have arrested multiple TRF members since then.', 'According to Indian government records, most armed fighters killed in gunfights in Kashmir were affiliated with the TRF in 2022.', 'The LeT, which calls for the “liberation” of Indian-administered Kashmir, was founded around 1990 by Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, who is also known as Hafiz Saeed.', 'In 2008, armed gunmen opened fire on civilians at several sites in Mumbai, India, killing 166 people.Ajmal Kasab, the only attacker captured alive, said the attackers were members of LeT. Saeed denied any involvement in that attack, however. Kasab was executed by India in 2012.', 'India also blamed Pakistani intelligence agencies for the attack. While Pakistan conceded that the attack may have been partly planned on Pakistani soil, it maintained that its government and intelligence agencies were not involved.', 'According to the United Nations, LeT was also involved in a 2001 attack on India’s parliament and a 2006 attack on Mumbai commuter trains that killed 189 people.', 'On May 7, India launched missileattacks on several citiesin Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. One of these cities was Muridke in the Punjab province.

The army also claimed Kasab had been trained at this camp.', 'Pakistan says LeT has been banned, however. Following an attack on Indian-administered Kashmir’s Pulwama in 2019, Pakistan also reimposed a lapsed ban on Jamat-ud-Dawa. Saeed was arrested in 2019 and is in the custody of the Pakistani government, serving a 31-year prison sentence after being convicted in two “terror financing” cases.', 'Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM), or “The Army of Muhammad”, was formed around 2000 by Masood Azhar, who had been released from Indian prison in 1999.', 'Azhar, who had been arrested on “terrorism” charges, was released in exchange for 155 hostages being held by hijackers of an Indian Airlines plane.', 'Azhar previously fought under the banner of a group called Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, which calls for Kashmir to be united with Pakistan, and has been linked toal-Qaeda.', 'According to the UN Security Council, JeM has also had links with al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and the Taliban.', 'Pakistan banned JeM in 2002 after the group, alongside LeT, was blamed for an attack on the Indian parliament in 2001.', 'The British-born Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, who was convicted of killing US journalist Daniel Pearl in 2002, was also a member of JeM. Pearl was the Wall Street Journal’s South Asia bureau chief. However, a 2011 report released by the Pearl Project at Georgetown University following its own investigation claimed that Pearl had not been murdered by Sheikh. The report instead alleged that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind behind the September 11, 2001 attacks, was responsible. In 2021, a panel of three judges at Pakistan’s Supreme Courtordered Sheikh’srelease.', 'Despite the ban, Indian authorities claim the group continues to operate in Bahawalpur, in Pakistan’s Punjab province.

Allying with regional minority groups may also appear attractive to some in Israel, although a similar strategy in the past, most notably in Lebanon during the 1975-1990 civil war, failed.', 'But the Israeli government is also facing internal pressure to act from its own Druze community, the vast majority of whom are supportive of the Israeli state and serve in the Israeli army, despite being Arabic-speaking.', 'The Druze community in the Middle East is split between Lebanon, Syria, Israel, and a small community in Jordan. They have played an influential role across these countries – in Syria, one of the leaders of the country’s independence was a famous Druze named Sultan al-Atrash.', 'Syria’s Druze are mostly split between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and Mount Hermon, Sweida (in an area called Jabal al-Druze, or Mountain of the Druze), and a couple of Damascus’s suburbs, while there is also a small community near Idlib.', 'Syrians in the occupied Golan Heights live under Israeli authority but most have rejected offers of Israeli citizenship. They’ve also historically been able to keep ties to Syria, sometimes studying in Damascus or marrying across the border, according to Tobias Lang, director of the Austrian Centre for Peace, who has extensively studied the Druze community in the Levant.', 'The Druze in Syria are, however, “very fragmented politically”, Lang said, due to years of life under the al-Assad dictatorship.', '“No distinct Druze leadership was allowed to emerge, and the traditional leadership lost much of its power to the Baathist regime,” he said, referring to theBaath party, which ruled Syria from 1963 to 2024.', 'During the war in Syria, competing voices emerged within the Druze community. Some, like Hikmat al-Hijri, the top Druze religious figure in Syria, initially supported the al-Assad regime. Others, like Wahid al-Balous, founder of the Men of Dignity Movement, split off from the regime much earlier and refused to send local men to die in support of the government.', 'Al-Balous was laterassassinatedin 2015. Opposition figures blamed the regime.', 'In 2023, when antigovernment protests erupted in Sweida, al-Hijri finally turned against al-Assad and supported the local opposition.', 'Al-Hijri has also been sharply critical of the new Syrian authorities since the outbreak of violence last month, calling the attacks against the Druze a “genocidal campaign”.', '“We no longer trust a group that calls itself a government, because the government doesn’t kill its own people through extremist gangs that are loyal to it, and after the massacre claims they are loose forces,” al-Hijri said.', 'The Syrian government has denied any involvement in the attacks on the Druze, and has instead emphasised that its forces have sought to provide security and prevent any further sectarian attacks.', 'Agreements struck between local actors and the new government at the start of this month have ended the fighting for now. But dozens of people had been killed, many civilians among them.', 'In Jaramana, locals are still on high alert.', '“We’re scared of our neighbours,” a resident told Al Jazeera, requesting anonymity for fear of retaliation against them or their family.', 'In the early days after the fall of al-Assad, places like Jaramana and Sweida were hesitant to work with the new Syrian government. Local leaders, some of whom are Druze notables, demanded a say in local governance and security matters.', 'But members of the Druze community have now been working with the central authority in Damascus to calm tensions, resolve disputes, and negotiate security arrangements.', 'Some of those agreements will see locals join the new government’s internal security force and police their own areas under the central government’s authority.', 'Still, locals are on edge after the clashes and fear they could restart. Locals told Al Jazeera that some Syrians, particularly from minority sects like the Druze, have had their faith in the new central authority shaken.', '“Trust [in the new government] began to decrease after theevents on the coast,” Jarbou said, referring to attacks in early March on Alawite – another minority community – in the coastal region after government forces were attacked. Hundreds were killed, many of them civilians, and while the government quickly announced an investigation into the attacks, the violence provided evidence for those fearful of the new order in Syria.', 'Syria has lived through 14 years of war and more than five decades of brutal dictatorship. For many in the country, the fall of Assad was a welcomed reprieve. For others, the fear and uncertainty from the Assad era has not completely dissipated.', '“In other words, we can say that the war hasn’t stopped,” Jarbou said, adding that a serious, participatory political solution is needed for the country. Should that not come to pass, the current pattern of clashes and increased communal tensions will only worsen.', '“Sedition is raging,” he said. “It’s not that we’re afraid of sedition. We’re in sedition now.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

Ukraine has dismissed that claim as “incomprehensible”.', 'More than 20 foreign dignitaries, including Xi and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, watched the 11,000-strong parade on Red Square.', 'The show of force was billed by Moscow as proof that the country has not been isolated by the war.', 'Throughout his quarter-century in power, Putin has tapped into the nation’s trauma over Soviet losses during the Great Patriotic War, which Russia dates as running from 1941-45.', 'With the two-year period of 1939-41, during which the Soviets maintained a non-aggression pact, with the Nazis sidelined, Victory Day has been elevated to become the country’s most important public holiday and a prime lever used to whip up patriotism.', 'Putin appeared to seek to transfer that mood to his war in Ukraine.', '“The whole country, society and people support the participants of the special military operation,” he said in his address to the parade, which reportedly included 1,500 soldiers who had fought in Ukraine.', 'Kyiv argued the parade has “nothing to do with the victory over Nazism” and that those marching on Red Square in a “parade of cynicism” were “quite likely” implicit in crimes against Ukrainians.', 'Amid the pomp and circumstance, security in Moscow has been tight, with authorities jamming mobile internet connections, citing the threat of Ukrainian attacks.', 'However, Putin’s unilaterally declared May 8-10 ceasefire teetered on the brink of collapse even as the parade opened on Friday morning, with both Kyiv and Moscow accusing one another of attacks.', 'Ukraine had dismissed Putin’s three-day pause as political theatrics, designed to avert the impatience of the United States – which has been trying to broker a ceasefire – and refused to commit to it, and had spent Tuesday and Wednesday using drones to target Moscow, shutting down its airports for significant periods.', 'Authorities in Russia’s western Belgorod border region said a Ukrainian drone attack hit the city council building on Friday, adding that no one was injured.', 'The Russian Ministry of Defence said Ukrainian troops had made attempts to breach the border in the Kursk and Belgorod regions, and claimed Ukraine had violated the ceasefire 5,026 times.', 'Ukraine claimed that just hours after the truce entered into effect, Russia had alreadybrokenit, with Moscow’s forces launching guided bombs against the northern Sumy region.', 'Kyiv reported further attacks on Friday in the southern city of Kherson and the central Dnipropetrovsk region, with two people wounded.', 'In a symbolic show of support for Kyiv to coincide with Friday’s parade, Ukraine’s Western allies backed a special tribunal to prosecute Putin and other senior Russian officials for the crime of aggression against Ukraine.', 'Foreign ministers from almost 20 European nations met in Ukraine’s western city of Lviv to sign the “Lviv statement”, a document paving the way for the establishment of the Special Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine, which could start operating next year.', '“We stand for a just and lasting peace, for a secure Europe, and for accountability and justice,” said United Kingdom Foreign Minister David Lammy in a statement.', 'The same day, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said a group of 10 northern European nations and the UK had agreed to support a US proposal for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.', 'That tallies with Ukraine’s response to Putin’s Victory Day ceasefire, which was to question why it would only run for three days and to call for a full 30-day truce.', 'The Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) coalition – which comprises Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the UK – met in Oslo on Friday.', 'Store said the group had contact the night before with US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss the

India confirmed the drone assault, but said it was responding to a provocation from Pakistan — missiles and drones launched towards cities and air defence systems in India and Indian-administered Kashmir. Pakistan denied that charge, and subsequent accusations of missile and drone attacks on parts of Indian-administered Kashmir on Thursday night.', 'With Pakistan denying any missile or drone strikes against India, Chaudhry’s warning of upcoming retribution remains alive, hovering over the 1.6 billion people of South Asia, 17 days after armed gunmen killed26 male civiliansin Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, triggering the current escalation.', 'Experts say how Pakistan responds will likely be shaped by its desire to demonstrate that it can hurt India, without pushing the crisis over the edge into a full-blown conflict.', '“We are still far away from a war, but we are much closer than we were 24 hours ago,” said Christopher Clary, assistant professor of political science at the University at Albany.', 'Clary said that the next “logical escalatory” step for both countries might be to target each other’s military bases.', '“We have already seen this with air defence-focused strikes,” Clary told Al Jazeera, referring to the Indian drone attacks that tried to target Pakistani radar systems overnight on May 7-8, and New Delhi’s claims that Pakistan launched missiles and drones towards its military facilities.', '“But I fear other strikes are likely in the next 24 hours. I think we are still several days from de-escalation,” Clary said, adding that more deaths are likely.', 'India and Pakistan have been at loggerheads since gaining independence from British colonial rule in August 1947, especially over the scenic Kashmir Valley in the northwestern subcontinent. Both control parts of it, with China in control of two thin slices. India claims all of Kashmir, while Pakistan claims all of Kashmir except the parts held by China, its ally.', 'They have fought multiple wars over Kashmir. The last major escalation occurred in February 2019, when India accused Pakistan of supporting armed groups responsible for a suicide bombing that killed 40 Indian soldiers in Pulwama, in Indian-administered Kashmir.', 'In response, India crossed the border for the first time since the 1971 war, launching air strikes in Balakot, Pakistan’s northwest, claiming to have hit “terrorist infrastructure” and having killed “hundreds of fighters”.', 'Pakistan countered that the area was a forest and reported no casualties. It responded the next day with its own fighter jets, leading to a dogfight and the downing of an Indian jet. The captured pilot, Abhinandan Varthaman, was later returned to India, easing tensions.', 'Kamran Bokhari, senior director at the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy in Washington, DC, called the current situation “much more dangerous” than in 2019.', 'India, he said, appeared to be locked into an “escalatory spiral”.', '“In case Pakistan makes a move, India will respond and up the ante,” he said.', '“This is a new situation for Pakistan. For the military to say that it will respond in a time of its own choosing suggests they want to think it through, to strike in a manner that does not lead to escalation. But how that materialises is a function of capability and constraint.”', 'It took India 12 days to respond to the Pulwama killings with the Balakot strike in 2019. In the current conflict, the Indian response took even longer, 15 days, via “Operation Sindoor,” which struck multiple Pakistani cities, including ones in Punjab, close to the Indian border.', 'Some analysts argue that while Pakistan has so far calibrated its response diplomatically and militarily, the drone strikes on Thursday morning marked a “serious escalation”.', '“The military is expected to respond in a manner that is firm and resolute, drawing on both public and political support. The scale of Pakistan’s response will be quite telling,” said Arsla Jawaid, associate director at global consulting firm Control Risks, while speaking to Al Jazeera.', 'She said Pakistan is likely to opt for precision strikes targeting Indian military assets while avoiding civilian casualties.', '“This could issue a decisive response while minimising further escalation. The latter will be a critical calculation in any Pakistani response,” she added.', 'Sahar Khan, a Washington, DC-based security analyst focused on South Asia, agreed that Pakistan will “definitely” respond.', 'Khan said India had crossed several “red lines,” including suspending the Indus Waters Treaty after the Pahalgam attack, and launching missile and drone attacks. TheIndus Waters Treaty(IWT), mediated by the World Bank and signed in 1960, governs the distribution of Indus River waters, critical for millions across the subcontinent, particularly in Pakistan.', '“The question is, what will they [the Pakistani military] target? That will determine the escalation dynamics and the eventual off-ramps,” she told Al Jazeera.', '“I think Pakistan will retaliate, showcasing its military capabilities. Its defence systems remain intact, and that is an added incentive to respond,” Khan added.', 'With brinkmanship at its peak and both sides locked in aggressive posturing, the greatest fear remains that even a small miscalculation could lead to a fully fledged war between two nations with more than150 nuclear weaponseach.', 'Bokhari warned that India’s strikes in Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous and prosperous province, marked a dangerous precedent.', '“By attacking Punjab, which was almost unthinkable, India has now made this the new normal. This is a real slippery slope,” he said.', 'Jawaid concurred, noting that drone strikes on Pakistani urban centres also suggest a shift in red lines.', '“That opens the door to a sustained and heightened risk of escalation, which is deeply problematic due to the risk of miscalculation on both sides. We are in a case of who blinks first,” she said.', 'But Khan believes that there are a fewpotential off-ramps.', '“The first is the international community, such as the US, China, and Russia, urging restraint. The second is for India and Pakistan to show willingness to redefine red lines, like India agreeing to the IWT again and Pakistan agreeing not to strike Indian military targets,” she said.', 'Jawaid, however, warned that even if India and Pakistan avoid a war, their already deeply strained equation has changed – there’s a new normal that will define it.', '“The longer this is sustained, the more challenging it becomes,” she said. “The bilateral relationship is already fraught with heightened tensions, which will continue even if the current conflict settles down, especially due to unresolved issues around natural resources and Kashmir, which remains a flashpoint.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

The Muslim-majority Pakistan gained its independence on August 14 that year as non-contiguous and culturally distant zones, West Pakistan and East Pakistan. The Hindu-majority but secular India gained its independence on August 15, 1947.', 'The partition was far from smooth, causing one of the largest and bloodiest human migrations ever seen, displacing about 15 million people. The process also sparked horrific communal violence and riots between Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs across the region, in which between 200,000 and two million people died. Border disputes andseparatist movementssprang up in the aftermath.', 'What stuck out as a major sticking point between the neighbours was the question of where the Muslim-majority Himalayan region, Kashmir, would go. The monarch of Kashmir initially sought independence and the area remained disputed.', 'In October 1947, the first war over Kashmir broke out when armed Pakistani tribesmen invaded the territory. The monarch of Kashmir asked India for its assistance in driving out the tribesmen. In return, the monarch accepted India’s condition for help – that Kashmir join India.', 'Fighting continued until 1948, when it ended with Kashmir divided. Pakistan administers the western part of Kashmir, while India administers much of the rest, with China holding two thin slices of Kashmir’s north. India claims all of Kashmir, while Pakistan also claims the part that India holds but not what China, its ally, holds.', 'The decade started with a promise of better ties.

That standoff only ended in October 2002, after international mediation.', 'In 2002, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, amid Western pressure following the 9/11 attacks, pledged that Pakistan would combat extremism on its own soil, but affirmed that the country had a right to Kashmir.', 'In 2003, during a UN General Assembly meeting, Musharraf called for a ceasefire along the LoC, and India and Pakistan came to an agreement to cool tensions and cease hostilities.

More than 160 people were killed in the attacks.', 'Ajmal Kasab, the only attacker captured alive, said the attackers were members of Lashkar-e-Taiba. Kasab was executed by India in 2012.

Clearing up the Vatican’s messy finances, therefore, is likely to be a major task ahead for Pope Leo who, helpfully, has a degree in maths.', 'The Vatican, which controls only its own budget and not that of the Catholic Church in other countries, has limited sources of income. It does not raise taxes or issue debt on which it could earn interest, such as bonds or loans.', 'Instead, most Vatican revenues come from its vast Italian real estate holdings and pontifical schools or hospitals in Rome. Together, these generated 65 percent of the Holy See’s 770 million euros ($875m) in revenue in 2022, the latest figure available.', 'That year, roughly 30 percent of revenues came from donations, which have remained relatively stable for the past decade, averaging about 45 million euros ($51m) per year and spiking to 66 million euros ($75m) in 2019.', 'The remaining 5 percent of the Vatican’s income in 2022 came from the Institute for the Works of Religion, or the Vatican bank, where Catholic organisations and church employees keep their accounts, and from tourism, which declined during the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'The Vatican hasn’t published a full financial report since 2022. But the last set of accounts – approved in 2024 for auditing purposes – showed an 83-million-euro ($94m) operating deficit, a big jump from the 33-million-euro ($38m) shortfall reported in 2022.', 'The Vatican’s growing financial problems have been attributed to rising operational costs, including salaries, security and building upkeep. On top of this, there is also a significant deficit within the Holy See’s pension fund.', 'The deficit in the fund was estimated at 631 million euros ($717m) by the Vatican’s Secretariat for the Economy in 2022. There has been no official update to this figure.', 'In past decades, many workplace pension funds underestimated how long retired employees would be likely to live. In 1960, for instance, Italy’s average life expectancy was 69, compared with 83 in 2022. This means many pension funds have not prepared adequately for the full amount they may have to pay out over a former worker’s actual lifetime and, therefore, have built up significant shortfalls.', 'It is not clear if the retirement fund for Vatican employees – a defined benefit scheme, which means it promises to pay a set amount of income to retirees regardless of the funds it has – has made adjustments to compensate for longer life expectancies. In November, however, the pope warned it would not be able to meet its liabilities over the medium term.', '“The data … indicate a severe prospective imbalance in the fund, the size of which tends to grow over time in the absence of interventions,” Francis said in a letter to the College of Cardinals. “This means that the current system is not able to guarantee in the medium term the fulfilment of the pension obligation for future generations.”', 'Last year, the pope appointed a new administrator – Cardinal Kevin Farrell, an Irish-American cleric based in Vatican City – and suggested that the pension fund’s operating structure may need to change but didn’t provide details. Funding the shortfall in the pension fund will be tricky. The church is likely to face opposition to using donations, for example, because these are generally made with specific charitable causes in mind.', 'After spending nearly 350 million euros ($398m) through a series of complex transactions to acquire aluxurious London propertyfrom 2014 to 2018, the Holy See suffered a public backlash.', 'In an effort to move on from the uproar over this spending, the Vatican sold the building in 2022 at a loss of 140 million euros ($159m). The transaction sparked questions about the Vatican’s opaque finances and eventually led to the corruption trial of Cardinal Angelo Becciu, who had overseen the deal.', 'The Vatican has been embroiled in other financial scandals as well. The most notorious was the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano, Italy’s largest private bank at the time, which caused the Vatican about $250m in losses. At the time, the Vatican had close dealings with Roberto Calvi, the bank’s powerful chief.', 'Calvi’s body was discovered hanging from Blackfriars Bridge in London with his hands tied behind his back shortly before it emerged that he had been party to a scheme to launder money through offshore companies, transfer illegal payments to Italian political parties and fund illegal arms deals.', 'During World War II, the Vatican was accused of laundering money and gold looted from Jews and other victims of Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime.', 'In 2019, Francis spearheaded an anticorruption drive that involved a police raid on the Vatican’s own bureaucracy and resulted in the Secretariat of State being stripped of its investment responsibilities.', 'In addition to the suspension of five Vatican staff members, the investigation led to the conviction of Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu, once a powerful figure, on multiple counts of embezzlement and fraud.', 'In the months before he died, the pope expressed particular concern about the Vatican’s finances. In September, he called on cardinals to pursue a “zero deficit” agenda and to improve the Vatican’s use of its economic assets.', 'Then in October, he ordered the third reduction in three years of Vatican cardinals’ incomes. Several Vatican department chiefs argued against the cuts and pushed back against the pope’s plans to seek outside funding to fix the deficits, two senior officials told the Reuters news agency at the time.', 'Francis was able to establish some momentum for financial reform. In 2021, the Vatican bank earned the highest possible rating from European watchdog Moneyval for its anti-money-laundering and antiterrorism standards. Ultimately, however, Francis was unable to eliminate the church’s deficits, and his successor will face a formidable financial challenge.', 'Pope Leo was very much an ally of Francis and may be keen to push on with his reformist agenda, perhaps by downsizing the Vatican’s global diplomatic presence – and therefore one vast expense. It remains to be seen, however, if he will be in favour of such far-reaching reforms as his predecessor and whether he can truly balance the books.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

They include the 750,000 people of Jammu, and millions more in Indian cities that on Thursday evening came under attack, according to the Indian government.', 'Eight missiles were fired from Pakistan-origin drones towards Jammu and nearby areas of Satwari and Samba, also targeting military stations in Udhampur and Indian Punjab’s Pathankot, said India’s Ministry of Defence.

Both armies traded heavy artillery as civilian injuries and deaths continued to rise. Amid gunfire, India has moved to evacuate thousands of people, who now sleep in shelters overnight.', '“There were attempts to target military sites in Jammu, including the defence airport,” a local intelligence official told Al Jazeera, requesting anonymity because he was not authorised to speak with the media. “We have confidence in [Indian] defence systems, however, the security situation is deteriorating.

He insisted that India was merely responding to escalation by Pakistan, also referring to the Pahalgam attack as “the original escalation point”.', 'Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded by denying any attacks on India or Indian-administered Kashmir, noting, “Any escalation based on false pretences will be met with full resolve and determination.”', 'Referring to global calls for restraint and de-escalation, Sumantra Bose, a political scientist focusing on the intersection of nationalism and conflict in South Asia, said, “The situation needs an urgentintervention by the international community, with effective diplomatic efforts to de-escalate.”', '“There is no support in the world for this senseless conflict,” said Bose, which he said, “has been rather mismanaged – and should never have been allowed to get to this point.”', '“Things have gotten out of hand very quickly and it is looking to get worse,” he said, reacting to the drone warfare and the alleged attacks on Jammu. “In the escalatory spiral, it is just retaliations; an endless loop of retaliations from both sides.”', 'Later on Thursday, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said, “We are remaining engaged with both governments at multiple levels.”', 'Acknowledging that Pakistan wants an “independent investigation” into the Pahalgam attack, Bruce said that the United States wants “the perpetrators to be held accountable and are supportive of any efforts to that end.”', 'However, Indian Foreign Secretary Misri had already rejected the calls for an independent investigation earlier in a media briefing, citing “no confidence in the Pakistani establishment for cooperation”.', 'The Trump administration, Donthi said, had, at least until May 7, “appeared willing to let the situation unfold between India and Pakistan”.', '“Unless the US and other international powers intervene more proactively to defuse the situation, it could lead to a full-blown war,” Donthi told Al Jazeera.', 'Bose, the political scientist, argued that “it is already a state of war.”', '“It would be much worse unless there is urgent, and effective, diplomatic intervention that makes the key decision makers, namely the Indian government and Pakistan’s military, to end this senseless belligerence and the spiral of escalation.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

A solemn silence fell across the square. The faithful waited to hear the pope’s first message, which would set the tone for his papacy.', '“Peace be upon you,” said Leo XIV, appearing on the central balcony of St Peter’s Basilica.', 'He proceeded to repeat a blessing uttered by his late predecessor, Pope Francis, just weeks earlier: “God loves us, God loves everyone, and evil will not prevail. We are in the hands of God.”', 'It was aclosely watched moment, with red-hatted cardinals poking out of nearby windows to catch their first glimpse at the newly minted pontiff.', 'Pope Leo XIV was elected on the second day of theconclave, and his opening remarks as leader signalled continuity with Francis, who died on April 21 at age 88. But experts say he is likely to strike a middle path, between furthering Francis’s inclusive agenda and embracing Vatican tradition.', '“Peace” was one of the most used words in his brief speech — a choice meant to echo the words that Jesus pronounced after Easter, as Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni explained during a news briefing.', 'Leo XIV called on Catholics to seek “a disarmed peace and a disarming peace” through “dialogue” and “building bridges”, in a brief speech heavy with themes of unity.', '“Bravo! That is what we need!” one audience member in the square shouted as the new pope spoke.', 'Another, 29-year-old Kasper Mihalak from Denmark, was squeezed in the middle of the crowd hoping to catch a glimpse of the first North American pope.', '“I am really excited. Cardinal Prevost, now Leo XIV — it’s gonna be amazing! He said a lot about peace during his speech. I think the world now really needs it,” Mihalak said.', 'Rosaria Venuto could hardly hold back her tears. Early in the morning, she picked up her two children and drove four hours from Ascoli Satriano, a small town in the southern Italian province of Apulia, to be in St Peter’s Square.', '“I am deeply moved to have the chance to be here and live through this joy and be a small part of this historical event,” she said.', 'Born in Chicago, a midwestern city in the United States, Leo XIV spent more than two decades in Peru, where he acquired dual citizenship.', 'There, he worked in some of Peru’s poorest areas, and he eventually became the bishop of Chiclayo, in the country’s agricultural north. Then, in 2023, Pope Francis appointed him to lead a powerful office that manages bishops across the world.', 'Phil Pullella, a Vatican expert who has covered the papacy for more than four decades, said that background offers a degree of continuity with Francis, who hailed from Argentina and advocated against poverty.', '“He knows about poverty in Latin America,” Pullella said of Leo XIV. “So, he’s not the same thing as if they had elected some cardinal of New York, for example.”', 'That continuity was likely appreciated by conservative camps at the Vatican, as well as liberal-leaning ones, Pullella added.', '“He comes from the wealthy world, but he witnessed firsthand the problems of the Global South in a poor country,” he said.', 'Still, Pullella noted that the way Leo XIV dressed showed that “he is going to be his own man”.', 'Instead of the simple white cassock that Pope Francis wore in 2013 when he was elected, Leo XIII added atraditional red capeover his vest, symbolising the spiritual and temporal powers of his office.', '“In a sense, he is going back a little bit to that kind of tradition,” Pullella said. “He would not have been elected had he not had the votes of the conservative bloc.”', 'Leo XIV’s election came as a surprise to many. Many observers were betting on a new pope by nightfall, but few expected only three rounds of voting.', 'The crowd was stunned when white smoke started to pour out of the tiny chimney by early evening, at around 6:09pm local time (16:00 GMT).', 'That was the signal that — of the 133 cardinals under the age of 80 who were eligible to vote — a candidate had received the two-thirds majority needed to become pope.', 'This year’s conclave had the distinction of being the most international in the Vatican’s history: The participating cardinals hailed from more than 70 countries, representing divergent views for the Catholic Church’s future.', 'The diversity was part of the legacy of Pope Francis, who appointed cardinals from underrepresented countries like Laos and Haiti to broaden the church’s global appeal.', 'Francis spent 12 years as head of the Catholic Church, shaking up the establishment by adopting a distinct style and tone, focused on austerity and advocacy for marginalised populations.', 'The late pope’s efforts caused excitement among reformers but also dismay among conservatives, who accused him of diluting the Church’s teachings. Experts say that led to a deep polarisation within the church, with some members criticising Francis for decentralising the church’s authority.', 'Those experts point out that Leo XIV’s experience in the Roman Curia — the church’s government — was likely a selling point among conservative conclave voters looking for stability in the years ahead.', 'While Pope Leo XIV’s first moves are yet to be revealed, his choice of name is noteworthy.', 'Bruni, the Vatican spokesperson, noted that “Leo” is a direct reference to Pope Leo XIII, who adopted a new social doctrine in the late 19th century.', 'In 1891, Pope Leo XIII wrote an encyclical — or papal letter — known as the Rerum Novarum. It called on Catholics to address the “wretchedness” facing the working class, amid the upheavals of industrialisation and political changes like the unification of Italy.', 'That encyclical marked a radical new approach to workers, and it triggered the creation of Catholic newspapers, social cooperatives and banks — a social movement that is still alive today.', 'Bruni said the current Pope Leo hoped to draw a parallel to that time, with its technological revolutions.', '“It is not a casual reference to the men and women of their work at a time of artificial intelligence,” Bruni explained.', 'Robert Orsi, a professor of religious studies at Northwestern University, said the name choice could also signify other historical parallels.', 'Leo XIII “strongly put down a movement called Americanism,” said Orsi.', '“This movement was a kind of nationalist impulse within Catholicism, with national churches claiming to have their own identities, their own particular ways of doing things,” he explained. “And I think by choosing the name Leo XIV, this pope was, without a doubt, signalling a return to a global Catholicism.”', 'Pullella also believes it is noteworthy that, while Leo XIV mentioned his parishioners in Peru, he avoided highlighting his ties with the US.', '“I think it’s very significant that he did not give a shout-out to the United States. He didn’t say, ‘I’m from America.’ He didn’t speak in English,” Pullella said.', 'That sent a message that “basically he’s not owned by the United States”, Pullella added. Leo XIV has previously been critical of the administration of US President Donald Trump over issues like nationalism and migration, just as the late Pope Francis was.', 'Still, Orsi predicted the Vatican under the new Pope Leo would be “subtle and wise” in how he deals with Trump in the years to come.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

He reflected on his time behind bars at a news conference where he and state officials announced the Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund.', '“\\u200aI was unjustly kidnapped or detained, if you want to go by the legal term,” Mahdawi said with a wry smile.', '“And without the support and the love that I received from the people of Vermont – Vermonters and the representatives of the people in Vermont – I may not have been here today among you.”', 'Mahdawi entered the national spotlight as a leader in the student protests at Columbia University, an Ivy League school in New York City that has been at the forefront of pro-Palestinian advocacy.', 'A legal permanent resident of the US, Mahdawi himself is Palestinian and grew up in the Far’a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. He has publicly described the oppression he said he experienced there, including the deaths of family members and friends at the hands of the Israeli military.', 'Since Israel launched its war in Gaza on October 7, 2023, Mahdawi has been outspoken in his opposition to the military campaign.', 'As an undergraduate at Columbia, he helped found student groups like Dar: The Palestinian Student Society and Columbia University Apartheid Divest. The latter has taken a lead role in protesting ties between the school and organisations involved with Israel and its military activities.', 'But President Trump has described such protests as “illegal” and pledged to crack down on non-citizen participants.', 'On March 8, Mahdawi’s colleague at Dar, Mahmoud Khalil, was the first student protester to be taken into custody for his role in the nationwide student protest movement. Others have since been detained, including Tufts University doctoral student Rumeysa Ozturk, who supporters say did little more than write an op-ed about the war in Gaza.', 'Just over a month later, on April 14, Mahdawi arrived at an appointment in Colchester, Vermont, ostensibly for his US citizenship application. Immigration officers, however, were waiting on site to arrest him, and he was led away in handcuffs.', 'Mahdawi was accused of no crime. The Trump administration, however, has accused him of harassing Jewish students and leading “pro-Hamas protests”, though it has not offered evidence to support those allegations.', '“His rhetoric on the war in Israel proves his terrorist sympathies,” a recentdocumentfrom the Department of Homeland Security said.', 'Mahdawi’s detention galvanised Vermont politicians on both sides of the political spectrum. Governor Phil Scott, a Republican, called on the federal government to release any evidence it had that Mahdawi was a threat to national security and denounced the surreptitious manner of his arrest.', '“What cannot be justified is how this action was undertaken. Law enforcement officers in this country should not operate in the shadows or hide behind masks,” Scott wrote in apress release.', '“The power of the executive branch of the federal government is immense, but it is not infinite, and it is not absolute.”', 'Meanwhile, Senator Peter Welch, a Democrat, visited Mahdawi behind bars at Vermont’s Northwest State Correctional Facility in an effort to raise awareness about his case.', 'Ultimately, on April 30, a federal district court deemed that Mahdawi was no flight risk and released him on bail, warning that the government’s actions could be interpreted as an attempt to “shut down debate”.', 'In his public appearance on Thursday, Mahdawi thanked his fellow Vermonters for showing him support and called on the state to act as an example to others.', '“Home is where you feel safe and loved. And those who surround you, they are your people, and you are my people,” he told the crowd.', '“This is a message of hope and light that our humanity is much larger than what divide us. Our humanity is much larger than unjust laws. Our humanity is much larger than being Democrat or Republican, Black or white, in a city or in rural area.”', 'Mahdawi also described how, when he was in detention, he saw an undocumented farm worker praying on his knees each night before going to sleep.', '“\\u200aI think his prayers have been answered today by this initiative,” Mahdawi said of the legal defence fund.', 'The fund’s organisers said they hope to raise $1m to “build a lasting safety net” for immigrant families in Vermont. That sum, they said, would fund training and hiring legal staff to respond to what they described as an immigration “crisis”.', '“Vermont is going to take action to ensure no one faces deportation, detention or family separation alone and unrepresented,” said State Senator Kesha Ram Hinsdale. “This will be embedded in our civic infrastructure in a way we have not achieved before and we hope will have long-term benefits beyond this immediate crisis.”', 'Vermont State Treasurer Mike Pieciak added that the fund would ensure justice is not solely reserved for those who can afford it.', '“This effort is not about politics. This effort is about principle,” he said. “The fundamental right to due process means very little if somebody cannot access legal representation, especially when they’re navigating a system as complex and as high stakes as the US immigration law.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

It also offers the clearest picture yet of the Biden administration’s political manoeuvring as public pressure mounted for accountability.', 'Abu Akleh was a US citizen, and during her final reporting assignment, she wore both a helmet and a blue vest clearly labelled with the word “press” to indicate her status as a journalist.', 'In the aftermath of her killing, the Biden administration faced pressure to investigate the circumstances of her death and whether the shooting was intentional.', 'But while the administration initially called for an “independent, credible investigation”, itshiftedits stance as the months progressed. It walked back calls for the killer to be “prosecuted” and eventually described the shooting as “the result of tragic circumstances”.', 'It also eased its scrutiny of the Israeli military, calling for accountability only in the form of a review of its “rules of engagement”.', 'The documentary Who Killed Shireen? features interviews from former Washington insiders about why the Biden administration made such a pivot. Its most damaging testimony comes from an anonymous official, who spoke with his face and voice obscured.', 'In the film, the official claims the evidence available to the Biden administration indicated that Abu Akleh’s death “was an intentional killing”. He said that assessment was based on the “visual capabilities of that day” and the distance between the Israeli snipers and the journalists who were shot.', 'Another journalist, Ali al-Samoudi, was also wounded at the same time as Abu Akleh, though he survived his gunshot.', '“Whether or not they knew it was her [Abu Akleh] or not can very well be debated, but they would have absolutely known it was a media person or a noncombatant at a minimum that [the Israeli soldier] shot and killed,” the anonymous Biden official said.', 'He added that it was his “belief” that the shooter would have been able to see Abu Akleh’s blue “press” jacket.', 'The official acknowledged the shift in the Biden administration’s position, from viewing the shooting as “an intentional killing” to describing it as “a tragic accident”. He linked that about-face to the historically close ties the US has shared with Israel.', '“Ultimately, I think what it came down to was different pressure within the administration to not try to anger the government of Israel too much, by trying to force their hand at saying they intentionally killed a US citizen,” the official said.', 'Another former US official, Andrew Miller, also spoke to filmmakers as part of the documentary. Miller served as the deputy secretary of state for Israeli-Palestinian Affairs from 2022 to 2024, and heindicated that the Biden administration had not been forthcoming about the stonewalling it faced from the Israeli government.', 'He said the government of then-Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett refused to allow the US access to the soldier who fired the fatal shot, even for “informal” questioning.', 'Miller also cast doubt on Israeli claims that Abu Akleh was shot during a crossfire with Palestinian fighters. He explained that the Biden administration had information from the start that contradicted those claims.', '“The fact that the official Israeli position remains that this was a case of crossfire … [that] the entire episode was a mistake — as opposed to potentially a mistake in identification or the deliberate targeting of this individual — points to, I think, a broader policy of seeking to manage the narrative,” Miller said.', 'The Biden administration had never publicly contradicted Israel’s assessment. Instead, when the Israeli military released its final report on the killing in September 2022, it said it “welcomed” the assessment.', 'That report asserted that Abu Akleh was “accidentally hit” by an Israeli bullet “during an exchange of fire in which life-risking, widespread and indiscriminate shots were fired toward” Israeli soldiers.', 'To date, the US government has neverdeclassifieda State Department report on the killing or confirmed media reports that the Department of Justice was conducting a separate probe.', 'Rights groups, press freedom organisations, and lawmakers have long called the Biden administration’s response inadequate, appealing for greater transparency and for the US to withhold aid to the military unit responsible.', 'Advocates said the latest revelations underscore a continued cycle of impunity.', '“The US government has acted as an accomplice to Israeli war crimes, not only against Palestinians but Americans, too, trumping loyalty to its own laws and citizens,” said Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the human rights organisation Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), in a statement responding to the documentary.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

He wasn’t happy, like, ‘Hey, I killed a journalist,’ of course, but he wasn’t … eating himself from the inside.”', 'Investigations by the filmmakers show Scagio was moved out of the Duvdevan to a commander position in a different unit, distancing him from any investigation, as a result, the filmmakers guess, of having killed Abu Akleh.', 'Scagio was later killed in June 2024 by a roadside bomb in Jenin, the same West Bank city in which he is accused of killing Abu Akleh.', 'As a result of the fallout from Abu Akleh’s killing, Scagio’s friend claims the Duvdevan unit took to using her image for target practice.', 'The killing of Abu Akleh came during what at the time was considered an intense phase of Israeli raids on the occupied West Bank. She was one of at least 145 Palestinians killed during the raids in 2022.', 'But since then, Israel has only ramped up its violence in both the West Bank and Gaza.', 'Israel has killed more than 52,000 Palestinians since it launched its war on Gaza in October 2023, decimating the territory and refusing the entry of food since March, starving the local population.', 'And in the West Bank, Israel has increased the severity of its attacks, using heavy weaponry and air strikes, and forcing Palestinians out of their homes. More than 900 Palestinians have been killed there.', 'Despite that, the US – both under former President Joe Biden and current President Donald Trump – has maintained its support of Israel, even as much of the rest of the world has criticised its actions.', 'At the United Nations, the US regularly votes alongside Israel, while the majority of member states seek to use the international body to pressure Israel to stop. And the US has threatened the International Criminal Court for seeking to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for committing war crimes.', 'It is, therefore, perhaps no surprise that, even though Abu Akleh was a journalist doing her job when she was killed and an American citizen, the US has been willing to look the other way.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

New Delhi has not yet issued an official statement confirming Trump’s remarks.', 'At a White House event alongside Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump said, “India has one of the highest tariffs in the world. We are not going to put up with that. They have agreed to drop it to … nothing.

Searchers are typically used for reconnaissance missions, while the Heron has similar missile capabilities to the Harop.', 'Multiple drones breaching Pakistan’s airspace, hovering in the country’s most populous regions, and managing to attack a military location imply that India has the capabilities to breach Pakistan’s air defence and strike its most crucial nerve centres.', 'The attacks, according to the Pakistani army, were an “extreme act of provocation” that could lead to a major escalation of violence between the two nuclear powers.', 'Additionally, the drone breach poses a potential threat to civil aviation safety in Pakistan.', 'The country’s civil aviation authorities temporarily suspended operations in four airports on Thursday, before lifting the restrictions: Allama Iqbal International Airport in Lahore, Jinnah International Airport in Karachi, Islamabad International Airport, and Sialkot International Airport.', 'Kashmir, famed for its picturesque lakes, meadows and snow-capped mountains, is at the heart of tensions between the two countries.', 'India and Pakistan both administer parts of it, as does China. But India claims all of it, and Pakistan claims Indian-administered Kashmir, too.

Pakistan has insisted it provides only moral and diplomatic support to Kashmir’s separatist movement.', 'New Delhi blamed April’s attack on an obscure group, The Resistance Front (TRF), and claimed it was Pakistan-backed.

Outside the chapel, there are others involved in the process, such as personnel handling logistics and security, cleaners, medical support staff and other clerics in supporting roles. About 100 additional people have taken the oath of secrecy over and above the voting cardinals.', 'Conclaves are inherently secretive, but experts say some information is available about what happens when the cardinals are not voting.', '“In the course of the days of the conclave, they will move by charter bus around St Peter’s to the Sistine Chapel, enter and have the morning vote,” Steven P Millies, professor of public theology at the Catholic Theological Union, a Catholic graduate school of theology in Chicago, Illinois, in the United States, told Al Jazeera.', '“They will return to the Domus Sanctae Marthae (Latin for Saint Martha’s House, the Vatican guesthouse) and have their midday meal, take their midday nap, and then return for the evening vote (to the Sistine Chapel). And then back again (to the Domus Sanctae Marthae) for a nighttime meal,” he added.', '“The Church emphasises that the conclave is a spiritual and sacred process, not a political one,” Father Francis Lucas said.', 'Some experts argue that most of the social activities and reflections on the previous vote might take place during their time in Saint Martha’s House.', '“One imagines that it is in the cafeteria at the Domus Sanctae Marthae, where people do eat cafeteria style, they put food on their own trays and that sort of thing,” Millies said.', '“There is a lot of time over meals and informal conversations for the cardinals to decipher the meaning of what just happened in the last vote and to try to figure out where their support might go best.

Hispromisesto hold elections and bring stability to parts of the country troubled by armed groups were tantalising for a nation under siege.', 'Nearly five years later, however, Goita has repeatedly reneged on those promises. The security situation has only marginally improved, with violence and killings – sometimes by government forces – reported regularly in areas outside the capital, Bamako, while elections have been postponed.', 'Somehow, popular support for Goita has largely held – until now.', 'Public anger at the military government was evident on May 3 when hundreds of people gathered in Bamako with defiant fists raised in protest. The demonstrations – a visible first against the military – came after government officials “proposed” at a national conference last week that Goita lead the country until 2030 and that political parties be dissolved.', 'On Wednesday, the governmentsuspended political parties“until further notice for reasons of public order”, before mass protests slated for Friday.', 'The rare revolts signal a reawakening by Malians, whose popular protests against previous rulers built the vacuum that allowed the military to seize power. Many had promised to return to the streets if the regime held on to power indefinitely.', '“For many people, even those who supported the government at first, this is a step too far,” Ousmane Diallo, Sahel researcher at Amnesty International, told Al Jazeera. “They see it as Goita trying to consolidate and hold on to power, and they have resolved to stand against it.”', 'The protests almost turned into an all-out brawl at the central Cultural Palace in downtown Bamako, as pro-transition youth armed with green-, gold-, and red-coloured Malian flags launched counter-rallies. Violence might not be far off, Diallo said, as more Malians are likely to react to the military government’s decrees. In July 2020,protests against the previous governmentwere met with violent crackdowns by security forces, and at least 14 people were killed.', '“There’s a real backlash now, and things could get more heated, especially if factions of the military decide to ally with the streets,” Diallo said, referring to possible mutinies within the army.', 'Goita’s coup in August 2020 came during a wave of mass antigovernment protests in Bamako because of advancing swarms of armed groups from the north. The groups – which are still active and aim to build caliphates – rendered huge swaths of the country ungovernable, sacking villages, killing civilians and displacing hundreds. ISIL affiliate in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) and al-Qaeda-linked Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) are two of the most active ones.', 'At the time, Malians blamed the civilian government for failing to deal with the threat. This despite assistance from a United Nations peacekeeping mission and former colonial power France, both of which had deployed more than 15,000 soldiers in northern Mali. So when young soldiers appeared on state television and declared a coup, most were in support.', 'Goita, 36 at the time, struck a visionary image with his promises of elections and peace. He installed a civilian-led transition government, while he stayed on as vice president. Under pressure from the regional body, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), to hold elections, Goita presented a transition charter spelling out that the military vice president could in no case be president, and that elections would be held in 18 months.', 'Signs that he would go back on his word came early, however. Goita staged another coup in May 2021, kicking out the civilian president and installing himself as leader. Then, in 2022, when the transition was meant to expire, the military rulers postponed elections and instead presented a five-year transition plan. ECOWAS, which had initially suspended the country, refused the deal. Opposition political parties protested in statements, but the military government has not changed track.', 'Meanwhile, several opposition politicians have been arrested, tried, and sentenced on charges such as taking part in an “unauthorised demonstration” or “opposition to legitimate authority” since Goita took power. Last July, the government suspended political parties and banned media coverage of “all political activities” for three months.', 'Analysts say even if Goita were to step down now and hold elections as initially promised, extensive damage to the country’s democratic institutions has already set in during his five-year term.', 'Mali, along withneighbouring militart-ledBurkina Faso and Niger, defied ECOWAS sanctions for failing to hold elections, and have since left the regional group. Together, they’ve formed the Alliance of Sahel States (AES). The military leaders in Burkina Faso and Niger have already extended their rule by five years.', '“The damage is not irreversible, but it’s going to be very difficult to get back on track [for elections] because things have gone very far from what was initially promised,” Diallo said.', 'One reason why Goita has enjoyed popular support thus far, analysts say, is because of recent gains recorded over armed groups and a secessionist coalition in the north.', 'Many people are also happy that Bamako has distanced itself from France, a former colonial power increasingly disliked across Francophone West Africa for what some see as its exploitative business interests. Some of the biggest French-owned companies in Mali include oil company Total and telecoms provider Orange.', 'French troops exitedMali in 2022 because Paris refused to back the military government. Bamako has since cut diplomatic ties and sent UN peacekeepers packing. In their place are Russian fighters from the Wagner mercenary group, known for their ruggedness and reported ruthlessness towards civilians.', 'Ulf Laessing, director of Sahel research at Germany-based think tank, Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, told Al Jazeera that while Russian fighters have helped stabilise parts of the north, the victory is far from complete as the armed groups have simply spread out into central and southern Mali.', '“The capital is safe and parts of the north, but outside that, it’s still difficult,”\\xa0 Laessing said. “In areas like [northern] Timbuktu, government control is still very weak, and the Russians haven’t been able to make a difference to that. There are only about 1,500 of them when even the French were 5,000.”', 'Although they havesuffered deadly ambushes, Wagner fighters helped secure the military’s biggest win in 2023 when Kidal, a rebel stronghold in the north, fell under government control for the first time in 10 years.', 'Back in 2012, Tuareg rebel groups who were fighting for an independent Azawad state seized Kidal and declared independence. They involved armed groups like JNIM, which later took over the campaign and spread into neighbouring countries, contributing to the current security crisis.', 'In 2015, a UN-mediated peace agreement with the secessionists was meant to see Tuareg fighters integrate into the army and Kidal return to government control. However, it was never implemented. Goita has since cancelled the agreement, pledging to restore all of Mali’s “territorial integrity”.', 'When Kidal fell in August 2023, it was both a tactical and symbolic win for the military. Goita’s supporters cite that as one example of why the strongman should stay on to secure the entire country. However, opponents say that argument is a pretext for the military leaders to stay in power for longer.', 'The military’s relative gains have also come at a cost for civilians, rights groups say. Russian fighters and Malian soldiers have been accused in numerous reports ofextrajudicial killingsof suspected “militants”, some of whom are wrongly profiled.', 'Ethnic groups like the Fulani and Dogon – perceived by the Malian army to be supporting armed groups – have been targeted in particular. In reality, experts say villagers themselves are often controlled against their will by powerful armed groups that have set up their own tax and judicial systems. There are reports of armed groups forcibly recruiting men from villages they occupy, while others join armed groups to avenge military attacks on their homes, experts say.', 'In December, Human Rights Watch (HRW) noted that the Malian army and Wagner fighters “deliberately killed” at least 32 civilians and burned 100 homes in central and northern Mali in 2024. JNIM and ISGS summarily executed at least 47 civilians, burned more than 1,000 homes, and displaced thousands of people between June and December alone, HRW said, adding that those numbers were conservative, at best.', 'Since Kidal fell, ethnic Tuareg have also been met with increasing levels of violence from the military, although it initially promised that civilians would be safe. Hundreds of people have fled into neighbouring Mauritania, dreading Wagner fighters or the “white men with masks” who burn homes and execute those they suspect of being rebel fighters, according to reporting by The Washington Post.', 'Some 3.3 million people are now believed to be displaced across Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger due to the violence, according to the UN’s refugee agency. The number of newly displaced people last year in Mali alone reached nearly 400,000.', 'As the political climate in Bamako becomes more restrictive, experts say Malians far from the centre are suffering the worst effects of the crisis. With the armed groups changing locations and continuing attacks, the purely military approach Goita insists on may no longer be sufficient, analysts warn, and dialogue might be necessary.', '“When you intensify fighting, you will, of course, see more attacks; it is just logical,” Diallo said. “And it’s ordinary civilians who are bearing the brunt of that.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

But analysts question that approach.', 'New Delhi, India –As Indian military officials took the podium next to the country’s foreign secretary at a media briefing on Wednesday morning, after unprecedented missile strikes into Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, a timeline of death played out on a video screen behind them.', 'The 2001 attack on the Indian parliament in New Delhi in which nine people were killed. An assault on the Akshardham Temple in the western city of Ahmedabad in 2002, in which 33 people died. The 2008 Mumbai attacks in which more than 160 people were killed. Several other attacks. And finally, the killings in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, in which gunmen shot down 26 people on April 22.', 'The May 7 missile strikes on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir were payback, New Delhi has said, for Islamabad’s refusal to crack down on armed groups that India insists have been financed, trained and sheltered by its neighbours over the past four decades. Islamabad denies that charge – though it acknowledges that some of these groups are based in Pakistan.', 'But the missile strikes were about more than retribution, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri suggested on Wednesday. The strikes, he said, were driven by “a compulsion both to deter and to pre-empt” attacks by armed groups launched on Indian territory. Misri accused Pakistan of failing to take “demonstrable steps” against “terrorist infrastructure on its territory or territory under its control”.', 'Yet as tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours escalate hour by hour, with Pakistan accusing India of launching a wave of drones into its territory on Thursday, military and geopolitical analysts question whether India’s approach serves as a deterrent against armed groups eager to target it. They argue that New Delhi’s actions are more symbolic and aimed at addressing its domestic audience rather than tactical advancement in the so-called “fight against terror”.', '“This is all a domestic theatre,” said Ajai Sahni, executive director of South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), a platform that tracks and analyses armed attacks in South Asia. “The Indian strikes [in Pakistan] have no deterrent value.', '“The aim of the strike has nothing to do with military takeaway – the aim [for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi] was to speak with his own domestic audience,” Sahni told Al Jazeera. “And [Pakistan’s pledge] of retaliation is to speak with the audience of the other side. That is the genius of it – that both sides will claim victory from this.”', 'The Indian army and Foreign Secretary Misri argued on Wednesday that the country’s security forces had been precise and careful in the selection of their targets.', 'Among them was Muridke, next to Lahore, Pakistan’s second-most populous city, and what India described as the Markaz Taiba camp of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), the group behind the 2008 Mumbai attacks.', 'At the media briefing with Misri, Indian Army Colonel Sofiya Qureshi referred to the site as the place where key perpetrators of the Mumbai assault – including Ajmal Kasab, the sole gunman who was captured alive – were trained. More than 160 people died in the Mumbai attack.', 'India also hit Bahawalpur, which New Delhi claims hosts the headquarters of the Jaish-e-Muhammad, an armed group behind the 2019 suicide bombing attack in Kashmir in which more than 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers were killed.', '“Justice is served,” the Indian army noted in a post on X as early reports of the missile strikes poured in on Wednesday, 15 days after the Pahalgam killings. The Indian missile strikes killed at least 31 people in Pakistan – all civilians, according to Islamabad – including two children. India has denied that it targeted civilians.', 'But Pakistan has threatened to hit back, and after Thursday’s drone attacks, the South Asian nations are even closer to a full-blown military conflict. Any hits taken by armed groups from Indian missiles won’t fundamentally change their ability to target India, said Sahni.', '“All these strikes will result in are certain tactical and operational adaptations,” said Sahni.', 'That – an adapted strategy on the part of armed groups – is precisely what was on display on April 22, when gunmen attacked tourists in Pahalgam, say experts.', 'In February 2019, after the suicide attack on Indian troops, Indian warplanes pierced Pakistani airspace and bombed Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where New Delhi claimed it hit “terrorists’ camps”. As Pakistan scrambled jets in response, a dogfight ensued, and an Indian Air Force jet was shot down. Pakistan captured the Indian pilot before returning him 60 hours later.', 'Both nations claimed victory – the Modi government in New Delhi said it had entered Pakistan and bombed “terrorists”, while Pakistan highlighted its downing of an Indian jet and the capture of a pilot as evidence that it came out on top. And so neither side, say experts, felt the need to really change.', 'That’s why Sahni said he believes no matter how the current tit-for-tat threats and attacks play out, they won’t alter long-term calculations for any of the actors involved. Instead, “the tensions will resurface, perhaps in different forms.”', 'A Kashmiri political analyst – who has seen India-Pakistan wars in 1965, 1971, and 1999, and three decades of Kashmiri armed rebellion against Indian rule – agreed. “If it was supposed to work, then Kashmir would not be standing where we are today,” they said, requesting anonymity, fearing reprisal from Indian forces. “One of the world’s most volatile flashpoints.”', 'Six months after the Pulwama attack, New Delhi unilaterally revoked the disputed Kashmir region’s partial autonomy and broke down the erstwhile state into two federally governed territories in August 2019. China and Pakistan, India’s neighbours that both control parts of Kashmir, condemned the move.', 'India then imposed a clampdown in Kashmir and arrested dozens of political leaders, journalists, and human rights activists, even as the Modi government claimed the region was returning to “normalcy”. Despite that – and the hundreds of armed rebels killed by Indian security forces over the years, “the armed movement continues,” Sahni pointed out.', '“The movement keeps on renewing itself [despite India’s countermeasures for three decades],” noted Sahni. “In the current attack, there has been a certain loss of material – buildings have been blown up – but if there is implicit support for these groups in Pakistan, they will always come back.”', 'In the early hours of Wednesday, the Pakistani military claimed it had downed at least five Indian warplanes that had been involved in the missile strikes. Local Indian officials and security sources confirmed to Al Jazeera and other media outlets that at least two fighter jets had “crashed”, though Indian officials have not commented on the issue publicly.', 'If the jets indeed belonged to the Indian fleet, “it will become difficult for India to make a decision in the future about sending in aircraft to impose punitive strikes on Pakistan,” said Ajai Shukla, a defence and strategic affairs commentator, who served in the Indian Army from 1976 to 2001.', 'Shukla noted that while a planned and rehearsed strike would have deterrent value, “the realities eventually depend on how much loss has been inflicted, compared to losses incurred.', '“It’s a moment where India needs to pause and think,” added Shukla. “Even when both countries claim victory, at least one of them in their heart of hearts knows that this was not a victory. This was something that turned out to be a fiasco.', '“If there is going to be an attitude that we will not admit anything and we will declare victory, then probably that weakness will never be eradicated,” Shukla said.', 'To Sahni, there’s a more imminent danger that has arisen from the strikes over the past two days. Previously, he said, both sides acted within unspoken but accepted “calibrated limits”.', 'Not any more.', '“There are no clear lines on what is ‘escalation’ now,” he said. “And that’s the classic slippery slope, on the edge of a risky spiral.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

According to multiple witness accounts, the attackers separated the men from the women and tried to pick non-Muslims as their targets.

It said the government had failed to show any “irreparable harm” that Ozturk’s transfer would cause.', '“Faced with such a conflict between the government’s unspecific financial and administrative concerns on the one hand, and the risk of substantial constitutional harm to Ozturk on the other, we have little difficulty concluding ‘that the balance of hardships tips decidedly’ in her favor,” the court wrote.', 'Though Ozturk is expected to be transferred to Vermont, where her habeas petition will be heard, the Trump administration is slated to continue with deportation proceedings in Louisiana.', 'The appeals court, however, explained that this should be no challenge for the Trump administration, given that Ozturk can appear through video conference for those hearings.', '“The government asserts that it would face difficulties in arranging for Ozturk to appear for her immigration proceedings in Louisiana remotely,” the court wrote. “But the government has not disputed that it is legally and practically possible for Ozturk to attend removal proceedings remotely.”', 'The Trump administration has the option of appealing the decision to the Supreme Court.', 'Likewise, Khalil faces deportation proceedings in Louisiana while his habeas petition is heard in New Jersey, closer to his home in New York City.', 'On March 8, he became the first high-profile case of a student protester being arrested for deportation. Agents for Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrived at his student housing building at Columbia University, where his wife, a US citizen, filmed him being handcuffed and led away.', 'Khalil himself was a US permanent resident who recently graduated from Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs. He is of Palestinian descent.', 'On Tuesday, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in New Jersey rejected a bid by the Trump administration to transfer Khalil’s habeas petition to Louisiana.', 'And on Wednesday, US District Court Judge Michael Farbiarz ordered the Trump administration to provide a specific assessment of the risks Khalil poses by being in the US.', 'Trump’s Secretary of State Marco Rubio has cited Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 to justify Khalil’s detention and deportation. A rarely used provision of the law allows secretaries of state to remove noncitizens who could cause “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences”.', 'But Rubio has so far been vague about what those consequences might be in Khalil’s case. The student protest leader has been charged with no crime.', 'Judge Farbiarz also required the Trump team to supply a catalogue of every case in which US officials have employed that law.

The impact of this consumption and investment is particularly severe in tropical regions such as the Amazon, Southeast Asia and Southern Africa – all areas of the world that have historically contributed the least to global emissions but have been disproportionately impacted by extreme weather.', '“Our study shows that extreme climate impacts are not just the result of abstract global emissions. Instead we can directly link them to our lifestyle and investment choices, which in turn are linked to wealth,” Schoengart said. “We found that wealthy emitters play a major role in driving climate extremes, which provides strong support for climate policies that target the reduction of their emissions.”', 'The authors argued that targeting the financial activities and investment portfolios of high-income individuals could lead to significant climate gains.', '“Climate action that doesn’t address the outsized responsibilities of the wealthiest members of society risk missing one of the most powerful levers we have to reduce future harm,” Schleussner said.', 'Owners of capital, he noted, could be held accountable for climate impacts through progressive taxes on wealth and carbon-intensive investments, thus providing much needed support for adaptation and damage in vulnerable countries.', 'Earlier research has shown that taxing asset-related emissions is more equitable than broad carbon taxes, which tend to burden those with lower incomes.', 'Recent initiatives to increase taxes on the superrich and multinationals have mostly stalled, especially since US President Donald Trump’s return to power in January.', 'In 2021, nearly 140 countries agreed to work towards a global corporate tax for multinational companies with nearly half endorsing a minimum rate of 15 percent, but those talks have stalled as well.', 'According to the antipoverty NGO Oxfam, the richest 1 percent have accumulated $42 trillion in new wealth over the past decade.', 'It says the richest 1 percent have more wealth than the lowest 95 percent combined.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

Perched at the podium in Munich, he shocked onlookers by criticising Europe, warning against laws and restrictions he said could “destroy democracy”.', 'It has been nearly three months since Vance delivered that speech, and on Wednesday, the vice president returned to the Munich forum, this time for its leaders’ meeting in Washington, DC.', 'In a question-and-answer segment with German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger, Vance revisited his February speech, which sparked backlash within Europe and at home. He also gave a preview of US negotiations over Iran’s nuclear programme and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.', 'Here are three key takeaways from his remarks.', 'Wednesday’s public appearance marked the third time Vance spoke to an event hosted by the Munich Security Conference. But his last speech — with its accusations of democratic backsliding — loomed heavily over the proceedings.', 'Vance tried to reframe his remarks on Wednesday as respectful criticism between allies, emphasising the warm relations the US and Europe have traditionally shared.', '“\\u200aI think — I mean this from the heart and as a friend — that there is a trade-off between policing the bounds of democratic speech and debate and losing the trust of our people. And we’re all going to draw the lines a little bit differently,” Vance said. “I’m fine if one country is going to draw those lines a little bit differently than the United States.”', 'He added that questions of free speech and democratic principles are issues the US is grappling with, too.', '“I think all of us, including especially the United States, we have to be careful that we don’t draw the lines in such a way that we actually undermine the very democratic legitimacy upon which all of our civilization rests,” the vice president explained.', '“\\u200aI think that is fundamentally the point here. It’s not Europe bad, America good.”', 'Ultimately, he said, Europe and the US are “on the same civilizational team”, and he underscored his belief that no wedge could come between them, even if the two parties exchanged criticism.', 'Vance also struck an upbeat tone in his assessment of the US’s efforts to scale back Iran’s nuclear programme, saying the two countries are on “the right pathway”.', '“\\u200aWithout prejudging the negotiations, I will say: So far, so good. We’ve been very happy by how the Iranians have responded to some of the points that we’ve made,” Vance said.', 'Vance’s optimism offered a counterpoint to concerns that the negotiations could be derailed by continuing tensions between the US and Iran.', 'Last week, a fourth round of talks expected in Romewere postponedfor “logistical reasons”, though experts pointed out that the delay coincided with a fresh slate of US sanctions against Iran’s petroleum industry. Those talks are slated to resume this weekend in Oman’s capital Muscat.', 'On Wednesday, Vance stressed the US position that Washington will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon, though he expressed ambivalence about nuclear energy for civilian purposes.', '“We don’t care if people want nuclear power. We’re fine with that. But you can’t have the kind of enrichment programme that allows you to get to a nuclear weapon. And that’s where we draw the line,” Vance said.', 'Still, the question of nuclear enrichment — even for civilian purposes — has been a point of contention in recent weeks. Certain US officials have signalled they would like to see Iraneliminate its enrichment programmealtogether.', 'For his part, Vance questioned whether it was likely Iran would use uranium enrichment solely for nuclear power, not weaponry.', '“Let me ask this basic question: Which regime in the world has civil nuclear power and enrichment without having a nuclear weapon?” Vance asked. “The answer is no one.”', 'Iran has long denied any ambition of seeking a nuclear weapon, and it has signalled it is willing to scale back its enrichment programme. Previously, it had signed onto a 2015 deal, called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), that imposed limits to its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.', 'During his first term, however, Trump withdrew the US from the agreement, causing the pact to fall apart. The US president has since sought to rekindle nuclear negotiations with Iran during his second term.', '“We really think that, if the Iran domino falls, you’re gonna see nuclear proliferation all over the Middle East,” Vance said.', 'The vice president also shared his insight into another area of tense international negotiation: the war between Russia and Ukraine.', 'Since February 2022, Russia has led a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, after capturing regions including Crimea in 2014.', 'In his campaign for re-election last year, Trump pledged to end the slow-grinding war, which has cost thousands of lives. He even claimed he would stop the war on his first day back in office, though he has since backtracked, telling Time Magazine he meant those remarks “figuratively”.', 'But Trump has nevertheless sought to act as a mediator between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. His administration, however, has been criticised for negotiating with Russia in isolation and seeming to acquiesce to Putin’s demands.', 'Trump, for instance, has echoed Russian talking points blaming Ukraine for the war and saying that Zelenskyy can “forget about” membership in the NATO military alliance. His officials have also suggested Ukraine was “unlikely” to regain the territory it had lost to Russia’s invasion.', 'Vance took a slightly tougher stance against Russia on Wednesday, underscoring that he and the Trump administration did not see eye to eye with Putin.', '“\\u200aYou don’t have to agree with the Russian justification for the war, and certainly both the president and I have criticised the full-scale invasion,” Vance said. “But you have to try to understand where the other side is coming from to end the conflict.”', 'The vice president sought to justify Trump’s approach as an effort to bring both sides to the negotiating table, in the spirit of what he called “strategic realism”.', '“Our view is: It’s absurd that you’ve had this war go on for so long. And the two sides aren’t even talking constructively about what would be necessary for them to end the conflict,” Vance explained.', '“\\u200aA frustration that we’ve had frankly with both sides is that they hate each other so much — that, if you have an hour conversation with either side, the first 30 minutes is just them complaining about some historical grievance from four years ago or five years ago or 10 years ago.”', 'Vance laid out his position that Russia is “asking for too much” in terms of concessions from Ukraine. But he also criticised Ukraine for sticking to a30-day ceasefire proposalthat initially emerged from talks with the US in Saudi Arabia.', '“\\u200aWhat the Russians have said is a 30-day ceasefire is not in our strategic interest,” Vance said. “So we’ve tried to move beyond the obsession with the 30-day ceasefire and more on: What would the long-term settlement look like?”', 'He added that he was “not yet that pessimistic” on the prospect of a negotiated peace, despite rumblings from the White House that Trump may withdraw from the negotiations altogether.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

And Modi, with his image as someone who delivers on national security, was catering to those sentiments. “India is retaliating in a precise manner,” Kidwai said.', 'In many ways, the May 7 Indian missile attacks were in keeping with the script New Delhi had outlined since the April 22 killings in Pahalgam, said Praveen Donthi, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group.', 'Like Kugelman and Kidwai, Donthi referred to the image that the Modi government has created for itself domestically. “This moment aligns with India’s self-projection as a strong security state with zero tolerance for terrorism, primarily directed against Pakistan, and Modi’s strongman persona. It was a self-created litmus test that the Indian government needed to ace,” he told Al Jazeera. “There are likely domestic dividends for it.”', 'But, Donthi warned, the Indian attack on Pakistan also “portends future risks”.', 'Kugelman agreed, describing the Wednesday missile attacks as “the most intense levels of Indian military actions we’ve seen in Pakistan for quite a few years now”.', 'Back in Pakistan, as officials pledge retaliation against what they call India’s “act of war”, Kugelman said the situation suits Islamabad’s military leadership, too.', 'The attacks “will actually bolster Pakistan’s current regime because the military leadership can use these attacks to rally the public around the military leadership,” he said. “The military has tended to derive its legitimacy from this idea that it needs to protect the country from the threat posed by India. We could see a rally around the flag effect [in Pakistan].”', 'Since the Indian attack, both armies have traded heavy artillery and gunfire across the de facto border in disputed Kashmir.

This was quickly refuted by the Vatican.', 'Another possible papabile is Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle. Hailing from a continent with the world’s most Catholics, the Filipino is popularly referred to as the “Asian Francis” due to their pastoral approach.', 'The 67-year-old was also the target of US and Italian conservative Catholic social media accounts that accused him of heresy after a video emerged showing him singing John Lennon’s Imagine six years ago – the popular song’s lyrics feature lines such as “imagine there is no heaven … no religion.”', 'Another Italian who is often mentioned is Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa.

Shortly after the tents started popping up, the campus also witnessed some of the first mass arrests of student protesters in the Palestinian solidarity movement.', 'That visibility has made Columbia a focal point for President Donald Trump’s efforts to crack down on what he called “illegal protests” and campus anti-Semitism.', 'Earlier this year, Columbia studentMahmoud Khalilbecame the first student activist to be detained by the Trump administration and targeted for deportation.', 'Tuesday’s delegation of Jewish students came to Congress to push the case that Khalil and others like him should never have been detained in their name. They met with at least 17 Democratic legislators from both the House of Representatives and the Senate.', 'Al Jazeera spoke to several students who participated in the lobbying day, which was organised by Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) Action, an advocacy organisation. Here are some of their stories:', 'Raised in upstate New York, history major Tali Beckwith-Cohen said she grew up in a community where Zionism was the norm. She remembers being told “myths” about Palestine as “a land without a people for a people without a land”: a slogan used to justify the establishment of Israel.', 'But as she began to learn Palestinian history and meet Palestinians, Beckwith-Cohen said her beliefs were challenged.', 'Eventually, after the war in Gaza began in October 2023, she became involved in Palestinian rights activism.', 'Human rights groups and United Nations experts have found evidence that Israel’s tactics in Gaza are “consistent with genocide”. More than 52,615 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict so far.', '“For a long time, I had this kind of feeling of discomfort, this feeling of wrestling, this feeling of maybe cognitive dissonance, and how can I reckon these values I hold dear with Zionism?” Beckwith-Cohen told Al Jazeera.', '“We are seeing the bombing, the disregard for human life, for children,for hospitals, for schools. It forced me to make a choice.”', 'She stressed that the protests were spaces of solidarity, where students of all backgrounds were committed to the idea that their safety is intertwined.', '“There’s so much in the media narrative about what’s happening on Columbia campus that is just disingenuous and just so untrue to what we’ve experienced,”\\xa0 Beckwith-Cohen said.', '“So we’re here today to tell our Congress people that what we’re seeing on campus is clearly an authoritarian, fascist crackdown on all dissent, not only students peacefully advocating for an end to genocide.”', 'When Carly Shaffer voiced concern about the Israeli escalation in Gaza on a university WhatsApp chat, some of her fellow students questioned her Judaism.', 'Out of the hundreds of people on the chat, she remembers that Khalil – the activist arrested for deportation – was the only person who contacted her directly to reject the comments she was subjected to.', 'As she got to know Khalil, she came to view him as the “embodiment” of someone who cared about the safety of all students on campus.', 'Shaffer told Al Jazeera that she felt “sick” and “horrified”when Khalilwas arrested. Her discomfort was then compounded when she saw that the Trump White Housecelebratedhis detention on social media with the phrase “Shalom, Mahmoud” – a Jewish greeting repurposed as a taunt.', 'Shaffer, who is pursuing a master’s degree in human rights and social policy, grew up in California and was raised by a single mother in a low-income household.', 'She said speaking out against injustice – including in Palestine – is a practice rooted in her Jewish faith.', '“The Columbia protest movement, it’s a movement of love. It’s a movement of solidarity,” Shaffer said. “And Jewish students are also integral and crucial to this movement.”', 'She said that, when Jewish student protesters held religious events on campus, their peers from the encampment joined them and inquired about their traditions.', '“These are the same students who are being portrayed as anti-Semites, who are going out of their way to go and learn about Passover and celebrate a Jewish holiday with their Jewish friends,” Shaffer told Al Jazeera.', 'She decried the “weaponisation of anti-Semitism”, saying that the issue is being used to shut down conversations aboutIsraeli atrocitiesin Gaza.', '“Jewish students are being used as pawns in Trump’s political agenda,” she said. “And the weaponisation of anti-Semitism to dismantle this movement is not just a threat to Jewish students; it’s a threat to all of us. That’s why it is so important for us as Jewish students to directly correct this false narrative.”', 'Barnard College student Sarah Borus, who was arrested during the crackdown on the Columbia encampment, said she grew up in an anti-Zionist family in a “very Zionist community”.', 'She felt it was important for Jewish students like herself to convey their experiences directly to the people in power in Washington, DC.', '“We’re talking to members of Congress to tell them our stories that are left out of mainstream news,” Borus told Al Jazeera.', '“Trump’s mission is not about protecting Jewish students. It is about using fears of anti-Semitism – because of the way that the Gaza solidarity encampment was portrayed last year – in order to target non-citizen student activists, in order to target academic freedom,free speech, and really put many, many people in danger.”', 'When asked how she feels about the potential backlash to her activism, Borus acknowledged that the current political climate left her fearful.', '“I’m scared, but in the grand scheme of things, I’m proud of the choices I have made,” she said. “I would not make any different ones, and I am willing to take on the risks, if that’s what must be done.”', 'Shay Orentlicher has no regrets about participating in Columbia University’s encampments, despite the administrative and political crackdowns.', 'Orentlicher saidChristian nationalistsare trying to erase the perspective of pro-Palestine Jewish students and define Judaism in a way that fits their political purposes.', 'But protesting against the killing of Palestinians, Orentlicher said, is an expression of both Jewish and humanist values. And Orentlicher believes that Columbia’s demonstrations have helped raise awareness nationwide.', '“Despite the oppression we have faced, despite the suffering, and despite the despair of worrying that we have not done enough to stopthe genocide, to stand up for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, I think we have shifted the public discourse in a really important way,” Orentlicher said.', '“And we also have built a really beautiful community. And I don’t regret what I did at all. I wouldn’t change anything.”', 'Raphie, who chose to identify by his first name only, said he grew up “very Zionist”. But as he learned more about the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, he felt he had been deceived.', '“The Jewish elementary school I went to, for instance, had a map of Israel, and it was like a diamond – no West Bank or Gaza on it,” he said.', '“When I saw the actual map with theoccupied territories, I was like, ‘Wait, I was lied to.’ And that kind of made me go on this whole journey of exploring what Zionism is, what occupation is, what settler colonialism is.”', 'Raphie, who is studying maths, said the war on Gaza, the campus protests and the backlash the student protesters faced all made him feel a “personal responsibility to fight for what is right”.', 'In his experience, the demonstrations were welcoming, not anti-Semitic. What was anti-Semitic, he said, was the fact that the university targeted Jewish student protesters for their political views.', 'Several students, including Raphie, said Columbia refused to grant students associated with Jewish Voice for Peace the permission necessary to hold religious celebrations in public spaces. They described that rejection as a form of discrimination.', 'The university did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment by the time of publication.', 'Raphie also drew a distinction between feeling uncomfortable about ideas that challenge one’s worldview and actually being unsafe.', '“It’s normal in college to encounter new viewpoints, new perspectives. That’s how I became more pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist,” he said. “I initially felt uncomfortable when I encountered anti-Zionist views, but then I grew to understand them. That’s normal.”', 'Raphie stressed that the real suffering is happening in Gaza.', '“The students who are not safe right now, of course, are thestudents in Gaza. Every university in Gaza has been destroyed. They haven’t had food for 60 days.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

That same day, he rescinded an order from his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, that allowed transgender troops to serve in the military.', 'Then, on January 27, he unveiled a newdirective, called “Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness”. It compared being transgender with adopting a “‘false’ gender identity”.', 'Such an identity, the order added, was not compatible with the “rigorous standards necessary for military service”.', '“Adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual’s sex conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life,” the executive order said.', '“A man’s assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.”', 'That executive order sparked a slew of legal challenges, including the one at the centre of Tuesday’s Supreme Court order.', 'In that case, seven active-duty service members – as well as a civil rights organisation and another person hoping to enlist – argued that a ban on their transgender identity was discriminatory and unconstitutional.', 'Advocates for the group point out that the seven have together earned more than 70 medals for their service. The lead plaintiff, Commander Emily Shilling, had spent nearly two decades in the Navy, flying 60 missions as a combat pilot.

Himself a former army captain, Settle was named to his position under former President George W Bush, a Republican.', 'In March, Settle blocked the ban on transgender troops, saying that – while the government made reference to “military judgement” in its filings – its arguments showed an “absence of any evidence” that the restriction had to do with military matters.', '“The government’s arguments are not persuasive, and it is not an especially close question on this record,” he wrote.', 'Other judges have likewise issued injunctions, including District Judge Ana Reyes in Washington, DC. She ruled in a case where 14 transgender service members sued against Trump’s ban, citing the right to equal protection under the law, enshrined in the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment.', '“The cruel irony is that thousands of transgender servicemembers have sacrificed – some risking their lives – to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the military ban seeks to deny them,” Reyes wrote in her decision, issued shortly before Settle’s in March.', 'Of the more than 2.1 million troops serving in the US military, less than 1 percent are estimated to be transgender.', 'One senior official estimated last year that there are only about 4,200 transgender service members on active duty, though advocates say that number could be an undercount, given the risk of violence and discrimination associated with being openly transgender.', 'The human rights groups Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation have been among those supporting transgender service members in their fight against Trump’s ban. The two organisations issued a joint statement on Tuesday denouncing the high court’s decision.', '“By allowing this discriminatory ban to take effect while our challenge continues, the court has temporarily sanctioned a policy that has nothing to do with military readiness and everything to do with prejudice,” they wrote.', '“We remain steadfast in our belief that this ban violates constitutional guarantees of equal protection and will ultimately be struck down.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

Experts believe Trump’s second term, which began on January 20, helped propel the Liberal Party’s comeback.', 'His remarks about Canada becoming a US state and his aggressive tariff policy alienated many Canadians, who felt their country’s close ties with the US had soured.', 'And some voters feared that Canada’s Conservative Party — which had previously been the frontrunner in the elections — might capitulate to Trump’s demands.', 'As Trump opened his sit-down on Tuesday with Carney, he gave a nod to the Liberals’ come-from-behind victory, joking that he took partial credit for the party’s electoral success.', '“I think I was probably the greatest thing that happened to him,” Trump said of Carney.', '“But I can’t take full credit. His party was losing by a lot. And he ended up winning. So I really want to congratulate him. It was probably one of the greatest comebacks in the history of politics. Maybe even greater than mine.”', 'Trump proceeded to shower Carney with praise, calling him a “very good” and “very talented person” with whom he had “a lot of things in common”.', 'By contrast, the US president launched barbs at Carney’s predecessor, fellow Liberal Justin Trudeau, who served as Canada’s prime minister from 2015 until March of this year.', '“I didn’t like his predecessor,” Trump said shortly. He also hinted at other tense relationships with other world leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with whom he had anOval Office shouting matchin February.', '“\\u200aThis is very friendly. This is not gonna be like we had another little blow-up with somebody else. It was a much different. This is a very friendly conversation,” Trump said.', 'Carney, for his part, responded with compliments of his own for Trump.', '“You’re a transformational president,” Carney said at the outset, praising the US president’s “relentless focus on the American worker”. He also drew a parallel between Trump’s leadership and his own, saying he had been elected “to transform Canada, with a similar focus on the economy” and “securing our borders”.', '“The history of Canada and the US is we’re stronger when we work together, and there are many opportunities to work together,” Carney said. “I look forward to addressing some of those issues that we have, but also finding those areas of mutual cooperation so we can go forward.”', 'The two leaders’ conversation, however, quickly shifted to one of the most contentious issues facing their countries’ ties: Trump’s threats to make Canada part of the US.', 'Since December, Trump has made regular remarks that Canada should be absorbed into the US as a 51st state, owing to an imbalance of trade.', 'According to the US government, Canada is the largest destination for US exports and one of its top three sources for imports. But Canada exports more to the US than it imports, creating a deficit of $63.3bn in Canada’s favour.', 'Experts say trade deficits are not necessarily a bad thing: They can indicate a stronger consumer base or differences in currency value. But Trump has repeatedly framed the US’s trade deficit with Canada as a “subsidy” that keeps the country’s economy afloat.', 'In the lead-up to Tuesday’s meeting, the US president pledged to broach the issue of statehood with Carney. “I’ll always talk about that,” he told the TV news programme Meet the Press on Saturday.', 'But during the public portion of their meeting, Trump took a more subdued approach, saying that, while he believed statehood to be a boon for Canada, he would not force the issue.', '“I still believe that, but it takes two to tango, right?” Trump told reporters. He later added, “I do feel it’s much better for Canada. But we’re not gonna be discussing that unless somebody wants to discuss it.”', 'He nevertheless revisited familiar arguments for combining the two countries, including that statehood would allow Canada to avoid the steep 25-percent tariffs the US has placed on many of its exports, including steel and aluminium.', '“I believe it would be a massive tax cut for the Canadian citizens. You get free military, you get tremendous medical care and other things. There would be a lot of advantages, but it would be a massive tax cut,” he said.', 'When Carney responded that Canada was “not for sale”, Trump doubled down, saying, “Never say never.”', 'But Carney scrunched up his face with a cheeky look and appeared to mouth the word “never” multiple times to the journalists circled around them.', 'He also attempted to steer the discussion to more neutral ground, praising Trump for pushing Western powers to invest more in military defence.', 'Still, reporters continued to press the two leaders about the controversial remarks. One asked Trump whether he would accept the will of the Canadian people not to become a 51st state.', '“Sure, I would,” Trump replied. “But this is not necessarily a one-day deal. This is over a period of time they have to make that decision.”', 'Carney once again chimed in with a brief but blunt response. “Respectfully, Canadians’ view on this is not going to change.”', 'Later, outside the Canadian embassy in Washington, DC, Carney described the Oval Office meeting as a turning point for their bilateral ties.', '“\\u200aToday marked the end of the beginning of a process of the United States and Canada redefining that relationship of working together,” Carney said. “The question is how we will cooperate in the future.”', 'In the Oval Office, Trump was unwavering in his commitment to imposing tariffs on Canada, describing the import taxes as essential to protecting US industries from competition.', '“Is there anything he can say to you in the course of your meeting with him today that can get you to lift tariffs on Canada?” a reporter in the Oval Office asked.', 'Trump responded with uncharacteristic brevity: “No.”', 'He later explained that it was his hope to create US industries that relied on no outside support, not even from close allies like Canada, whose economy is intimately interwoven with that of its southern neighbour.', 'Trump referenced the decline of the American auto and steel industries as motives for his tariffs.', '“We want to make our own cars. We don’t really want cars from Canada, and we put tariffs on cars from Canada. At a certain point, it won’t make economic sense for Canada to build those cars,” Trump said. “And we don’t want steel from Canada because we’re making our own steel, and we’re having massive steel plants being built right now as we speak.”', 'He also repeated his false assertion that the US trade deficit with Canada amounted to a “subsidy” — and he appeared to cast doubt about whether Canada’s economy would survive without US support.', '“They have a surplus with us, and there’s no reason for us to be subsidising Canada,” Trump said. “Canada will have to be able to take care of itself economically. I assume they can.”', 'Carney, meanwhile, highlighted the close relations the US and Canada have enjoyed in the past, arguing that cross-border trade has made both of their economies stronger.', '“We are the largest client of the United States in the totality of all the goods. So we are the largest client in the United States,” he said. “Fifty percent of a car that comes from Canada is American. That’s not like anywhere else in the world.”', 'Both leaders agreed that the current United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) needed to be renegotiated. Canada has framed Trump’s tariffs as a violation of the free-trade agreement, which was signed under the US president’s first term in 2019.', '“\\u200aThe USMCA is great for all countries,” Trump said during Tuesday’s Oval Office meeting. But he added that the deal was a “transitional step” that would “get renegotiated very shortly”.', 'Carney echoed that assessment, saying that the USMCA would be a launchpad for broader discussions.', '“It is a basis for a broader negotiation. Some things about it are going to have to change,” he said, offering measured criticism of Trump’s tariff policy. “Part of the way you’ve conducted these tariffs has taken advantage of existing aspects of USMCA, so it’s going to have to change.”', 'While much of the Oval Office discussion revolved around trade, Trump briefly veered into the topic of international conflicts, saying that the war in Ukraine would feature heavily in his closed-door discussions with Carney.', 'He also announced his administration would end its nearly two-month-long bombing campaign in Yemen, where the US military has beenattackingHouthi strongholds.', 'The US Central Command has said more than 800 targets have been bombed since Trump began the US’s latest round of strikes on March 15, known as Operation Rough Rider.', 'But the effort has been riddled with controversy. Aid groups have warned of civilian casualties, including the suspected bombing of amigrant centrein Saada, in Yemen’s north.

We unpack what his threat, if enforced, could mean; which film industries might take a hit; how his tariff targets might retaliate and how this would affect ticket prices.', '“The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform. He added that other countries are offering “all sorts of incentives” to drive filmmakers and studios away from the US.', '“This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat,” Trump wrote.', 'Trump also described foreign films as “messaging and propaganda”.', 'He said he was authorising the Department of Commerce and the US Trade Representative “to immediately begin the process” of imposing a 100 percent tariff on films coming into the US which are “produced in Foreign Lands”.', 'On Monday, the White House appeared to take a step back.\\xa0“Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump’s directive to safeguard our country’s national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said.', 'Meanwhile, California Governor Gavin Newsom also announced on Monday that he wants to create a $7.5bn federal film tax credit to boost the entertainment industry, working with the Trump administration.', 'That’s one of the many questions that have arisen from Trump’s threat.', 'As with most things, films in a globalised world rarely rely on resources from just one country: Hollywood movies, for instance, might have an American financial backer but could be shot in other countries, with actors and crew from different parts of the world.', 'For instance, one of 2024’s top-grossing Hollywood films, Wicked, was filmed in Sky Studios Elstree in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, in the United Kingdom.', 'Parts of Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, released in 2023, were filmed in Warner Brothers’ studios in Leavesden, Hertfordshire in the UK. Barbie’s California-esque Dreamhouse was actually built in a UK studio. During filming, Barbie’s production generated more than 80 million pounds ($106m) for the UK economy, creating jobs and supporting local businesses.', 'Trading bright pink pool slides for candy-churning Rube Goldberg machines, the same studio morphed into Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory in Paul King’s Wonka, released later that year.', 'Many US movies last year were also filmed partly or completely in Australia, including The Fall Guy, a comedy action film starring Ryan Gosling, and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes. Australia’s federal government offers incentives for big film projects in Australia, including a 30 percent rebate under the location offset scheme. New Zealand offers similar tax break incentives.', 'Released in the same year, US Gothic horror film Nosferatu was filmed in Prague, Czech Republic. US movies have also been filmed in New Zealand, Spain and Germany, among other countries.', 'On the flip side, many non-US films are shot at least partly in the US. Successful Bollywood movies of the past two decades have used the Brooklyn Bridge, Miami’s beaches and Chicago’s neighbourhoods as backdrops for plots that have ranged from romantic comedies to robberies – adding to the attraction of US cities for Indian tourists. It’s unclear whether such films – which bring revenue to the US – would classify as “foreign” films.', 'Indian films generate significant revenue from markets abroad. The 2016 film, Dangal, a biopic of India’s famous wrestling sisters, Geeta Phogat and Babita Phogat, generated about $12.4m from the US and Canada, according to website Box Office India.', 'Indian films gross about $100m at the US box office, Shibasish Sarkar, president of the Producers Guild of India, told the Press Trust of India (PTI) on Monday. “The diaspora market, which is price-sensitive, became a revenue source for Indian films,” filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri told PTI. Sarkar and Agnihotri speculated that ticket prices would increase if the tariffs were applied. “I don’t think anybody will watch them in theatres, especially when the films will be available on Netflix, Amazon, etc,” Agnihotri said.', 'The US is home to 5.4 million people of Indian origin, the largest Indian diaspora population in the world.', 'But it isn’t just Indian films that earn significantly in the US. Paddington in Peru, the 2024 film that’s part of the UK franchise revolving around Paddington, the anthropomorphic bear, earned more than $45m in the US.', 'Films from South Korea also fare well in US markets. In April this year, animated film The King of Kings, directed by Seong Ho Jang, earned $54.7m at the box office, surpassing Bong Joon-ho’s 2019 film Academy Award-winning Parasite, which generated $53.8m in the US. These are the top-earning South Korean films in the US. But The King of the Kings is an English-language film, starring big Hollywood names such as Oscar Isaac. Parasite is a Korean-language film.', 'On the other hand, films from countries like China are barely reliant on US viewership – with language still a barrier they haven’t been able to overcome.', 'In February this year, Chinese animated film Ne Zha 2 became the highest-grossing animated film in history, making $1.9bn from nearly 80,000 screens four weeks after its release, according to Chinese ticketing platform Maoyan. More than 99 percent of the Mandarin-language film’s box office income came from mainland China. Yolo, the Chinese comedy superhit from 2024, earned only $2m in the US despite being the 14th highest-grossing film globally, according to IMDb’s Box Office Mojo.', 'Australian home affairs minister and minister for the arts, Tony Burke, responded to Trump’s threat: “Nobody should be under any doubt that we will be standing up unequivocally for the rights of the Australian screen industry.”', 'New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said his government was awaiting further details on the tariffs. “We’ll have to see the detail of what actually ultimately emerges. But we’ll be obviously a great advocate, great champion of that sector and that industry,” he said.', 'Philippa Childs, the head of UK media and entertainment union Bectu, called on her government to protect its film industry.', '“These tariffs, coming after COVID and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering,” Childs said.', 'US media stocks fell on Monday in the aftermath of Trump’s announcement. The shares for streaming giant Netflix fell by 2.5 percent in early trading, while Disney, Warner Brothers and Comcast also declined between 0.7 and 1.7 percent.', '“There is too much uncertainty, and this latest move raises more questions than answers,” PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told the Reuters news agency. “It doesn’t feel like something that will happen in the short term as everyone will be grappling to understand the whole process. Inevitably costs will be passed on to consumers.”', 'In recent years, Hollywood has faced several setbacks, among them the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Last year, Hollywood studios grossed about $30bn globally, down by about 7 percent from 2023, according to Gower Street Analytics. Despite last year’s performance being better in terms of revenue than 2020, 2021 and 2022, it was still about 20 percent\\xa0below the pre-pandemic average.', 'In 2023, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) – trade unions representing Hollywood writers and performers – went on strike, demanding better working conditions and stronger protection against AI use. This led to the closure of some studios while others scaled back staff.', 'In January this year,wildfiresravaged Los Angeles, the home of Hollywood. Several filming locations for television and movie productions in southern California were damaged or destroyed. Many actors alsolost their homesto the fire.', 'Many in the US film and television industry have rallied to bring production back to Hollywood, urging California legislators and Governor Newsom to enact measures such as raising tax incentives to bring this to effect. The argument is that Hollywood is full of middle-class workers, gig workers and local businesses hit by a decline in production.', '“If we don’t stop the bleeding, then Los Angeles is at risk of becoming Detroit,” said filmmaker Sarah Adina Smith, an organiser of the “Stay in LA” campaign that calls for productions to remain in the city, Reuters reported in April.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

Will his successor consider women as deacons and priests next?', 'Rome, Italy– When Pope Francis was elected in 2013, he faced loud calls to expand the role of women within the Roman Catholic Church.', 'To some extent, he delivered. Francis opened key meetings to women; allowed them to senior roles within the powerful central bureaucracy of the Church; and appointed the first female head of the Vatican governorate. For some, these were giant strides for a deeply conservative institution. But to many others, Francis’s moves fell short of what was needed to make the Church truly inclusive.', 'Now, as cardinals hold daily meetings before beginning theprocess of votingfollowing his death on April 21, the role of women in the Church remains a divisive issue. When the cardinals finally emerge from their cocoon in the Vatican, will they have picked a pope who will build on Francis’s changes — or someone who might roll them back?', '“Women are not holding their breath,” said Kate McElwee, the executive director of Women’s Ordination Conference, a nonprofit focused on women’s rights within Church institutions. “There is some anxiety on whether the next papacy will see some backsliding on the progress because there is a real desire for the project of [women’s] inclusion to continue.”', 'Francis’s legacy, when it comes to women in the Church, is still up for debate.', 'He gave women the power to vote on issues related to the Church at the Synod of Bishops. He also appointed a dozen women to high-ranking positions, including Barbara Jatta as the director of the Vatican Museums, Sister Raffaella Petrini as the president of the powerful Vatican City State, and Sister Simona Brambilla as the first female prefect of a Vatican office overseeing religious orders for both men and women. Overall, throughout Pope Francis’s papacy, the presence of women in the Church’s workforce rose from about 19 percent to 23.4 percent, according to Vaticanfigures.', 'But to some, these were just cosmetic changes. The pope did not move forward on the polarising issue of women’s ordination, particularly as deacons or priests.', 'In the Catholic Church, the role of a deacon involves certain religious functions, such as assisting during mass and performing baptism, but does not allow carrying out most sacraments.', 'Pope Francis set up two commissions – the first in 2016 and the second in 2020 – to consider whether women could serve as deacons by studying if that was the case in the early centuries of the Church. The report produced by the first group was never released to the public as the commission was not able to agree on the issue, according to Francis, while the second never concluded its work. In 2024, during an interview with US broadcaster CBS, Pope Francis gave a flat “no” to the ordination of women deacons. But a few months later, he signed off on the final document of a synod, saying the issue should remain an “open” question.', '“It feels like he unlocked the door but didn’t fully open it,” McElwee said.', 'And as for women becoming priests, Pope John Paul II in 1994 issued a ban that has since been repeatedly reaffirmed.', 'That underrepresentation is in stark display these days as members of an all-male body are discussing the fate of the Church. At pre-conclave meetings in Rome, cardinals are discussing what they believe are the core issues and priorities that a future pope should be able to tackle – from the Church’s sexual and financial scandals and the global crisis of faith to the ties with China and the importance of canon law.', 'Most of the cardinals who willvote for the new pontiffinside the Sistine Chapel this week have been appointed by Pope Francis and are aligned with many aspects of his agenda, such as social justice, migration and climate change. Yet, observers say they have not spelled out their positions on women in the Church clearly.', 'In 2023, Cardinal Anders Arborelius, the bishop of Stockholm, Sweden,saidit was “important to see that there are other ways” for women to serve the Church “than ordained ministry”. And in a speech at a pre-conclave meeting this week, Beniamino Stella, an Italian cardinal seen as close to the late pope, surprised fellow clergymen by accusing Francis of having created “chaos” in the Church by opening the governance of Vatican offices to men and women who were not part of the clergy.', 'Sister Marie, a nun who arrived in the Vatican from Marseille, France, awaiting the election of the new pope, agreed.', '“Everybody has their role and we are happy to stay at our place, which is not within the hierarchy of the Church,” she said, asking her surname to be withheld. “It [women as deacons or priests] would denaturalise the institution of the Church and the process of transmitting the faith,” she said.', 'There is also the conservative guard that was outraged by Francis’s decision to appoint nonclerical people to top positions. In an interview with the Italian newspaper Repubblica last week, Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Muller from Germany, a leading conservative, noted how the Roman Curia – the administrative body of the Roman Catholic Church – is an ecclesiastical body that should not be managed by lay people, likely a criticism of Sister Brambilla’s appointment last year.', 'Still, the Church cannot afford to ignore the subject of women and their role any more, suggested Sabina Pavone, a professor of history of Christianity at the University of Naples L’Orientale and member of the Italian Society of Historians.', '“There is an awareness that this topic needs to be addressed because it continues to be considered one of the hot topics, but how to address it – that is not clear yet,” Pavone said.', 'The issue of women’s inclusion in the Church is increasingly also a practical matter central to the very functioning of Catholic institutions, she pointed out. Women already run the show in many areas of the world, from managing parishes, supporting local healthcare systems and teaching, while fewer men are entering the priesthood in most places.', '“The Church has already changed,” Pavone said. “And the Church has to keep pace with this reality.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

When a massive star explodes, it leaves a very dense, collapsed core behind, which is called a neutron star.', 'Astronomers theorise that the first magnetars were formed after the first stars about 13.6 billion years ago, according to study coauthor Eric Burns, assistant professor and astrophysicist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. The Big Bang created the universe 13.8 billion years ago.', 'On rare occasions, magnetars can release high-energy radiation by undergoing a “starquake”. Like an earthquake, a starquake can fracture the magnetar’s crust. Sometimes, magnetar starquakes bring with them a magnetar giant flare, a rare explosive event that releases gamma rays.', 'The researchers found that magnetars release material during giant flares. However, they do not yet have a physical explanation for this.', 'The researchers speculated about whether magnetar giant flares formed gold through the rapid process of neutrons forging lighter atomic nuclei into heavier ones. An element’s identity is defined by the number of protons it has. However, if an atom acquires an extra neutron, it can undergo nuclear decay, which can turn a neutron into a proton.', 'A changed number of protons can change the element’s identity. Neutron stars have an extremely high density of neutrons. If a neutron star is disrupted, singular atoms can quickly capture a number of neutrons and undergo multiple decays. This leads to the formation of much heavier elements like uranium.', 'Before this study, the creation of gold was attributed only to neutron star collisions, or kilonovas. When astronomers observed a neutron star collision in 2017 through telescopes, they found the collision could create heavy elements such as gold, platinum and lead. However, these collisions are believed to have happened relatively later in the history of the universe, in the past several billion years.', 'However, the archival telescopic data, which was previously indecipherable, showed that magnetar giant flares formed much earlier. Hence, the study indicates that the first gold could have been made from magnetar giant flares.', 'NASA has an upcoming mission that can follow up on these results. The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a gamma-ray telescope that is expected to launch in 2027.', 'COSI will study energetic phenomena in the Milky Way and beyond, such as magnetar giant flares. According to the NASA website, COSI could identify individual elements created in the giant flares, helping to form a better understanding of the origin of the elements.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

They had been living there with three other members of the family of Shakeela’s brother since she separated from her husband a decade ago.', 'As soon as Shakeela opened the door, a large contingent of policemen stormed inside, barely offering any explanation before detaining her son for allegedly associating with a rebel outfit – a charge the family has contested in a court of law.', '“They [police] told me he would be back in a few days, but days turned into months and months into years,” Shakeela told Al Jazeera as she struggled to hold back her tears.', 'Arrested under the draconian Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), an anti-terror law that effectively allows people to be held without trial indefinitely, Faizyaab was first sent to a Srinagar jail before being transferred last year to another facility in Jammu, nearly 300km (186 miles) away from home.', 'While Shakeela had her brother’s house to stay, she depended on her college-going son’s part-time job with a private company for financial support. She has been unable to see her son for the past eight months and does not have the money to travel to Jammu.', '“I have no source of income. My son was my only support, and even that was cruelly taken away,” she told Al Jazeera.', '“Another Eid [al-Fitr] came and went without my son, a time meant for joy and celebration, but for me, it felt like just another ordinary day. My son wasn’t there to greet me. My Eid will only come the day he walks free,” she said.', 'Like Shakeela, many families with relatives imprisoned outside the Kashmir Valley struggle to visit them, mainly due to financial constraints.', 'In southern Kashmir’s Pulwama district, Ishrat (name changed), 29, waits for her 25-year-old brother to come home. She requested that Al Jazeera not disclose her brother’s name – worried that media attention might affect his chances of securing freedom.', 'Ishrat’s brother was booked under the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act (PSA) in June 2023 for allegedly being an “overground” associate of the rebels. The PSA is an administrative law that allows the arrest and detention without trial of any individual, with no warrant or specific charge, for a period of up to two years.', 'Since 2018, more than 1,100 people jailed under the PSA have been relocated to prisons outside Kashmir, marking a significant shift in the region’s detention practices. That trend picked up particularly after 2019, with the government citing overcrowding in local jails as the reason behind the shift.', 'Ishrat’s brother was initially jailed in Jammu and was soon transferred to a prison in Uttar Pradesh state, more than 1,000km (620 miles) away from home. Since then, his family has been unable to visit him due to the high travel costs involved.', 'Ishrat told Al Jazeera her brother faces several hardships in prison, such as poor sanitation. During the month of Ramadan, she said her brother and other prisoners had to save the food provided at lunch for iftar (meal to break the fast) and conserve their dinner for suhoor (predawn meal). She said the only ceiling fan in his cell is mounted nearly 25 feet (7.6 metres) high, offering little relief during north India’s brutal summer.', '“Every day in that prison cell feels like a day in the fires of hell,” she said, describing her brother’s condition.', 'Meanwhile, the health of their mother, who is in her late 40s, has been deteriorating, Ishrat said. Consumed by grief, she longs for her son’s return and spends most of her days in tears. Their only solace comes twice a week when Ishrat’s brother is allowed a brief five-minute phone call from jail – barely enough to bridge the distance that separates them.', 'Ishrat recalled that during the assembly elections last year, candidates from various political parties campaigned in her village, pledging in their speeches to secure the release of the detainees, or at least have them transferred to Kashmir.', 'Ishrat said that every member of her family voted, assured that a new government would take decisive action in the matter. But nothing of the sort has yet happened.', '“It feels like the government has forgotten us after the elections, failing to fulfil its promises and leaving families like ours deeply disappointed,” Ishrat said.', 'She said if her brother had committed a crime, he should be punished as per the law, but held in a jail in Kashmir. “Holding my brother in a prison far from home is a form of collective punishment for us.”', 'Al Jazeera reached out to officials in Kashmir’s prison department for their comments on detentions and shifting of prisoners, but has not received a response.', 'NC spokesman Imran Nabi Dar defended the regional government, saying the removal of Kashmir’s statehood and a New Delhi-appointed lieutenant governor’s control over security matters were impediments to the fulfilment of their promises.', '“Only a few months have passed [since the regional government was formed] and the party has a full five-year term to serve the people,” he told Al Jazeera. He said that the party remained committed to fulfilling every pledge made during the elections, and urged people “to have faith and patience”.', '“We have consistently stated that individuals detained since 2019 who do not face serious charges and those held unjustly deserve to be released. We remain firm in our commitment to that promise,” he said.', '“I understand the pain and frustration these families are going through. We have not forgotten them, and we assure them that this issue will be resolved soon,” said Dar, adding that the situation in Kashmir has changed after the Pahalgam attack, which has “worsened the already fragile conditions”.', '“These are challenging times for Kashmir,” he told Al Jazeera on Monday, highlighting a significant spike in security measures and alooming threat of warwith Pakistan.', 'Meanwhile, authorities in Kashmir have detained or questioned thousands of people in the wake of the Pahalgam attack. Local media reports, citing the police, say at least 90 people have been booked under PSA. Several homes of suspected rebels and their alleged associates have beendemolished, deepening the anxiety among residents.', 'Kashmiri academic and political analyst Sheikh Showkat Hussain told Al Jazeera that “arrests have consistently been used to deprive individuals of their personal liberty in Kashmir, especially since the rise of mass uprisings and militancy [rebellion]”.', 'He said holding people in prisons outside the region makes their ordeal even harder, placing an immense burden on both the detainees and their families. The practice, he said, not only violates India’s constitution and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, “but also fuels further alienation among Kashmiris, worsening an already fragile situation”.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

The church counts some 1.4 billion\\xa0baptised Roman Catholics around the world as members.', 'Elections in the Vatican are not immune to lobbying and campaigning. First, the cardinals must hold a series of congregazioni – special meetings at which they will discuss what sort of leader they are looking for. While only 135 cardinals will be able to vote, as they are below the age of 80, as per the voting rules, all cardinals can attend these meetings irrespective of age.', 'Roberto Regoli, a professor of Catholic Church history at Rome’s Pontifical Gregorian University, said that unlike in a normal election, none of the top contenders in the Vatican is openly canvassing to be elected. Most people would say they do not want the post if asked, he said.', '“It’s a lot of work,” Regoli told Al Jazeera. “You have no time to do anything for yourself.”', 'Results can often be surprising, and experts are wary of speculating in advance. In 2013, for example, Pope Francis was not even counted as a favourite in the media. It was only after a speech he gave at one of the congregazioni that he was noticed.', 'Here’s what we know about some of the possible candidates.', 'The College of Cardinals will ultimately elect one of their number to be the next pope. There are currently 252 cardinals, 135 of whom are cardinal electors as they are under the age of 80 – the cut-off date for papal elections.', 'After a few days of meetings, the 135 voting cardinals will be sequestered in the Vatican’s Sistine Chapel on May 7 in what is known as a “conclave”. They will have no access to phones, the internet, or the outside world. No cardinal can leave until a name is pronounced, barring exceptional circumstances.', 'Cardinals will vote in one or several secret ballots to elect the new pope. The winner needs a two-thirds majority.', 'Observers standing outside the Vatican will know a pope has been selected by the colour of the smoke emerging from the chimney of the chapel: black means no consensus, white means a new pope has been declared.', 'Conclaves usually last for several days or, in some cases, weeks. Pope Francis was elected in two days.', 'Francis’s reforms changed the makeup of the College of Cardinals. He appointed 80 percent of the current cardinals, selecting them from around the world – with a particular emphasis on the Global South – and choosing people with different ideological leanings.', 'For the first time, countries like Mongolia, Iran and East Timor will be represented. Among the cardinals are people who are conservative on topics such as same-sex marriage and divorce, as well as others who are less orthodox. The bigger mix of views – and the much larger representation of the Global South – makes this vote a particularly unpredictable one, experts say.', 'In their meetings before the conclave, the cardinals will be trying to decide if they want a liberal-minded leader like the late Pope Francis, a more traditionalist pontiff like his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, or someone with moderate tendencies.', 'Cardinals will also likely be looking for someone skilled in international diplomacy, Regoli said, with the world facing multiple conflicts and changing geopolitical dynamics. The church would also prefer someone not too young, to ensure a relatively short tenure.', 'Ideology and geography will also play a role, historian Miles Pattenden, who is associated with the University of Oxford, told Al Jazeera.', '“Francis was known to be spontaneous, and the church might be looking to elect someone more cautious in his reactions,” he said. And, with the Catholic population growing in Asia and Africa, the cardinals may want to send the message that an Asian or African pope is more representative.', 'Personal charm, though, is the secret ingredient. Because many of the cardinals have rarely met, it is hard to know who might get along well with whom. The next pope will be the cardinal who, without appearing to do so, can convince the others that he can represent the church globally and address the church’s challenges: adapting to secularisation, and coping well with recent sex and financialscandals, as well as declining membership in the West.', 'Most of all, electors do appear to be looking for a sober and unifying figure who can bring stability to the church’s central government after Francis’s more revolutionary style of leadership.', 'Here is a list of candidates, in no particular order, who experts believe are frontrunners.', 'Some observers believe the future of the church’s leadership lies outside the traditionally elected class of Italian cardinals.', 'Tagle, from the Philippines, might suit the cardinals who want that growth to be more visible. The country is the most Catholic in the world, with 80 percent of its 100 million people identifying as Catholics. If elected, Tagle would be the first Asian pope in recent history.', 'Ordained a cardinal in 2012 by Pope Benedict, Tagle currently leads the church’s evangelisation programmes from the Vatican. A former archbishop of Manila, Tagle is popularly referred to as the “Asian Francis”. His style of leadership is similar to the late Pope Francis’s pastoral approach, Pattenden said.', 'While he is opposed to abortion, he is dedicated to social justice causes such as migration and poverty, and has pushed for a less harsh stance on gay people, divorcees and single mothers. Senior roles within the Holy See since 2019 have also seen him gain Vatican experience.', 'Italian and present Vatican secretary of state, Parolin’s background and position within the church mean he has a strong chance of being considered for pope. He has held the number two position in the Vatican since 2013.', 'With diplomatic stints for the church in Nigeria, Mexico, Spain and Italy, he is regarded as a skilled, stable hand on the world stage. He has pushed to improve China-Vatican relations, which have been strained because of the Holy See’s recognition of Taiwan.', 'Parolin’s supporters say that while he agrees with some of Francis’s ideals (he supports embracing the divorced and opposes the United States administration’s plans for Gaza), he is also a pragmatist who understands the nuances of diplomacy and may take a more moderate approach than Francis. Critics, however, say he lacks pastoral experience and might put diplomacy above the church’s interests.', '“Parolin or Tagle might best represent some kind of continuity of the Francis style if that’s what the church decides is the way to go,” Pattenden said.', 'Of three prominent African frontrunners, Turkson, who hails from Ghana, is seen as the more moderate and, thus, more suited to diplomacy. The cohort of African cardinals is, in general, regarded as quite conservative, particularly when it comes to the position of women in the church and same-sex marriage.', 'Experts previously marked Turkson as a favourite in 2013. Although he leans more conservative than liberal, he is opposed to the criminalisation of gay relations in Ghana, where a bill imposing harsh penalties on homosexuality has been passed.', 'There has never been an African pope, and such an election would be “ground-breaking”, Pattenden said.', 'Described as cautious and risk-averse, the Hungarian priest is a respected lawyer and staunch conservative who is likely to have backing from those seeking a change of approach from Pope Francis’s style of leadership.', 'Erdo, as the archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest, is seen by critics as friendly to the Hungarian right-wing and anti-migrant governing party, Fidesz, causing some observers to describe his candidature as one to be afraid of. While he is not directly opposed to the rights of people to migrate, Erdo has raised questions about how integrating refugees might endanger political stability in Hungary. Critics cite this stance as one close to approving Fidesz’s criminalisation of migrants.', 'Some also say Erdo has been unwilling to properly investigate allegations of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church.', 'In an opinion piece in the United Kingdom’s Guardian newspaper, Hungarian journalist Alex Faludy wrote that Erdo’s name on the list should make observers “fearful”.', '“Erdo’s possible ascent to the papal throne would be bad news for LGBTQ+ Catholics and those who have remarried after divorce,” Faludy wrote. “It should, however, also worry abuse survivors and anyone concerned with the integrity of Christianity’s presence in public life.”', 'The priest was viewed as a favourite in 2013, when he was 60 years old, but did not gain strong backing. At the time, observers said he was seen as too young.', 'Another well-recognised diplomat, an Italian and archbishop of Bologna, Zuppi led a peace mission to Ukraine in 2023 and helped mediate an end to the Mozambique civil war in 1992.', 'He was appointed cardinal in 2019 by Francis, whose ideals he broadly agrees with.', 'As a member of the Catholic humanitarian group, the Community of Sant’Egidio, Matteo would be expected to focus on increasing outreach to disadvantaged or crisis-hit communities.', 'The archbishop of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Besungu represents a key demographic in the church: the DRC has more than 7 million Catholics, making it the biggest Catholic country in Africa.', 'Cardinal Besungu is staunchly traditionalist. While he has spoken out against human rights violations in his homeland, he is unequivocally against blessing same-sex relationships (which Pope Francis introduced), even standing up and criticising Pope Francis about his rulings on the topic.', 'He is another favourite for the conservative camp.', 'Originally from Czechoslovakia but raised in Canada, the cardinal leads the social justice operations of the Vatican.', 'He was appointed by Pope Francis and is, like him, a Jesuit – an arm of the church known for its focus on education, missionary work and charitable activities. The two men were considered to be close.', 'Czerny has worked in Africa and Latin America and founded the African Jesuit AIDS Network.', 'Experts say it is possible Czerny will appeal to progressives in the church, but there are doubts about whether the College would immediately vote for another Jesuit pope.', '“Normally, we don’t have two consecutive popes of the same order,” Regoli said.', 'From Italy, Pizzaballa is the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, where he has lived since being ordained as a priest at 25 years old.', 'Pope Francis appointed him as cardinal in 2023.', 'He has a good understanding of the complexities of the Palestine-Israel conflict, Israel’s ongoing war on the Gaza Strip and Middle Eastern relations.', 'Pizzaballa has spoken out against the Gaza war, rebuking both sides. In the early days of the war, he offered to exchange himself for child captives taken during Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.', 'Pattenden said that one critical factor the church will look at is age. Pizzaballa, at 60, is much younger than Pope Francis was when he was elected (76). That means, even if a strong contender, Pizzaballa’s age might not appeal to some voters.', 'The Guinean cardinal is perhaps the most traditional and orthodox of all the frontrunners and is one of the most recognised African church leaders.', 'He was appointed archbishop of Conakry at the age of 34 and was, at the time, the youngest bishop in the world. His outspoken nature placed him on an assassination hit list by the former Guinean dictator, Ahmed Sekou Toure. The list was discovered after Toure’s death.', 'In 2001, Pope John Paul II promoted Sarah to head of evangelisation, opening his sojourn into the Vatican proper.', 'Pope Benedict appointed him as a cardinal in 2010 and he retired from active office in 2021 as prefect for Divine Worship and Discipline of the Sacraments.', 'He reportedly had turbulent relations with Pope Francis, however.

Medical missions are not allowed to bring anything in with them.', 'So, the doctors struggle on with the equipment they can find, sometimes reusing “disposable” medical implements over and over, despite the danger that poses, because there is simply no other choice, Dr Rachdan says.', 'At the back of their minds, several doctors tell Al Jazeera, is always the thought that people in Gaza die of wounds and illnesses that would be easily treated in any other hospital that has adequate supplies.', '“Sometimes we can’t cover a patient or take precautions to preserve the sterility of an operating room,” Dr Hijjawi says.', '“Sometimes I don’t have the right size metal plates or screws that I need to mend a limb.

Then he asks a little boy to wiggle his toes so he can check on how he’s healing.', 'Next is a young girl lying under a recovery blanket in a room on her own. Her right arm is bandaged, which is what he’s there to look at.', 'He squats on the floor near her bed and moves her arm, then each of her fingers. He’s concerned because she seems to have lost sensation in two fingers and feels the problem will have to be explored surgically, as he tells a concerned relative.', 'The children are quiet, wide-eyed, doing as they’re told and not saying much else.', '“There’s so much they’re dealing with,’ Hijjawi says. “Being in the hospital is scary, but on top of that, so many of them are just lying there waiting, hoping, for someone to visit them – a parent or grandparent or sibling.

Vaccine hesitancy has been blamed.', 'Here is what we know about the outbreaks so far and why measles cases are on the rise.', 'Measles is a highlycontagious viral illnessthat starts with symptoms including high fever, cough, runny nose, red or watery eyes, and sensitivity to light. A few days after infection, a red, blotchy rash typically appears on the face and spreads down the body. Fatigue and loss of appetite are also common.', 'Most people recover within two to three weeks but complications, particularly in young children and those with weakened immune systems, can be serious.', 'These include ear infections, diarrhoea, pneumonia and brain swelling (encephalitis) which can lead to permanent disability or death. In wealthier countries, measles causes about one death in every 5,000 cases, but in lower-income regions with weaker healthcare systems, the fatality rate can be as high as one in 100.', 'Before the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, about 3 to 4 million cases of measles were reported annually in the US, with hundreds of deaths and thousands of hospitalisations. By 2000, following widespread vaccination, measles was declared “eliminated” in the US – meaning there had been no continuous transmission of the disease for more than 12 months. Countries that have eliminated a disease through vaccines are considered to have “herd immunity” as long as vaccines continue to be offered to everyone.', 'Herd immunity occurs when enough people in a community become immune to a disease, either through vaccination or by recovering from an infection.', 'The number of people who need to be immune in order to achieve herd immunity for the whole community varies from disease to disease. Measles, which spreads very easily, requires 95 percent of a community to have immunity.', 'When most people are immune, the disease has a much harder time spreading – meaning it is more likely to die before it can be transmitted to another host. This helps to protect those who cannot be vaccinated for specific reasons, including newborn babies or people with certain health conditions.', 'Experts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination due to the potentially severe effects of a measles infection.', 'According to the World Health Organization (WHO), measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.', 'The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.', 'The vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries likethe United Kingdom.', 'Breakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.', 'North America is experiencing a significant measles resurgence, with more than 2,500 confirmed cases across the US, Canada and Mexico. Three deaths have occurredin the USand one in Mexico. The outbreak began in late 2024 in Ontario, Canada, before spreading to Texas and northern Mexico in early 2025, with Mennonite communities (Anabaptist Christian congregations), a historically under-vaccinated population, being the hardest hit.', 'A WHO report in April stated that measles cases in the Americas during the first three months of this year were 11 times higher than during the same period in 2024. The region now faces a “high” risk of measles outbreaks, compared with a “moderate” risk globally, the WHO said.', 'The US has so far reported 935 confirmed measles cases across 30 states, withTexas being the epicentreof the outbreak, accounting for 683 of those cases. The outbreak has now also spread to New Mexico (67 cases), Oklahoma (16) and Kansas (37).', 'Three people died from measles between February and April, including two unvaccinated children in Texas and one unvaccinated adult in New Mexico. These mark the country’s first measles deaths since 2015.', 'In 2019, the US experienced its most significant measles outbreak since 1992, with 1,274 confirmed cases reported across 31 states, but no deaths.', 'Meanwhile, Canada is experiencing its worst measles outbreak in more than 25 years. Since mid-October 2024, Ontario alone has recorded more than 1,000 cases.', 'Canadian officials confirmed that the outbreak had originated from a large gathering in New Brunswick province that involved Mennonite communities, which strive for a simple life and tend to avoid modern technology and medicine.', 'In Mexico, the number of measles cases has risen sharply this year in the northern state of Chihuahua, where 786 cases have been reported so far. Just seven cases were reported in the whole country last year. A 31-year-old, unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April.', 'According to the WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the main reason measles is spreading is thatfewer people are taking up vaccines. Misinformation and growing hesitancy have seen vaccination rates dropping below the level needed for herd immunity.', 'In some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.', 'The US CDC reported that during the 2023-2024 school year, exemptions from one or more vaccines were claimed by parents or carers of 3.3 percent ofpreschool children, compared with 3 percent the previous year.

Pakistan has threatened to walk away from the 1972 Simla Agreement that committed both nations to recognising a previous ceasefire line as a Line of Control (LoC) – a de-facto border – between them in Kashmir, a disputed region that they each partly control but that they both claim in its entirety. Both nations have also expelled each other’s citizens and scaled back their diplomatic missions.', 'Despite a ceasefire agreement being in placesince 2021, the current escalation is the most serious since 2019, when Indialaunched air strikeson Pakistani soil following an attack on Indian soldiers in Pulwama, in Indian-administered Kashmir, that killed 40 troops. In recent days, they havetraded fireacross the LoC.', 'And the region is now on edge, amid growing expectations that India might launch a military operation against Pakistan this time too.', 'Yet, both countries have also engaged their diplomatic partners. On Wednesday, United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar, urging both sides to find a path to de-escalation. US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth called his Indian counterpart, Rajnath Singh, on Thursday to condemn the attack and offered “strong support” to India.', 'Sharif met envoys from China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, three of Pakistan’s closest allies, to seek their support, and urged the ambassadors of the two Gulf nations to “impress upon India to de-escalate and defuse tensions”.', 'To understand how Pakistani strategists who have worked on ties with India view what might happen next, Al Jazeera spoke with Moeed Yusuf, who served as Pakistan’s national security adviser (NSA) betweenMay 2021 and April 2022under former Prime Minister Imran Khan.', 'Prior to his role as NSA, Yusuf also worked as a special adviser to Khan on matters related to national security starting in December 2019, four months after the Indian government, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, revoked thespecial statusof Indian-administered Kashmir.', 'Based in Lahore, Yusuf is currently the vice chancellor of a private university and has authored and edited several books on South Asia and regional security. His most recent book, Brokering Peace in Nuclear Environments: US Crisis Management in South Asia, was published in 2018.', 'Al Jazeera: How do you assess moves made by both sides so far in the crisis?', 'Moeed Yusuf:India and Pakistan have for long struggled in terms of crisis management. They don’t have a bilateral crisis management mechanism, which is the fundamental concern.', 'The number one crisis management tool used by both sides has been the reliance on third parties, with the idea being that they would try and restrain them both and help de-escalate the crisis.', 'This time, I feel the problem India has run into is that they followed the old playbook, but the leader of the most important third party, the United States, didn’t show up to support India.', 'It appears that they have so far taken a neutral and a hands-off position, as indicated by President Donald Trump few days ago. (Trump said that he knew the leaders of both India and Pakistan, and believed that they could resolve the crisis on their own.)', 'Pakistan’s response is directly linked to the Indian response, and that is historically how it has been, with both countries going tit-for-tat with each other. This time too, a number of punitive steps have been announced.', 'The problem is that these are easy to set into motion but very difficult to reverse, even when things get better, and they may wish to do so.', 'Unfortunately, in every crisis between them, the retaliatory steps are becoming more and more substantive, as in this case, India has decided to holdIndus Water Treatyin abeyance, which is illegal as the treaty provides no such provision.', 'Al Jazeera: Do you believe a strike is imminent and if both sides are indicating preparedness for a showdown?', 'Yusuf:In such moments, it is impossible to say. Action from India remains plausible and possible, but the window where imminence was a real concern has passed.', 'What usually happens in crises is that countries pick up troop or logistics movements, or their allies inform them, or they rely on ground intelligence to determine what might happen. Sometimes, these can be misread and can lead the offensive side to see an opportunity to act where none exists or the defensive side to believe an attack may be coming when it isn’t the case.', 'Pakistan naturally has to show commitment to prepare for any eventuality. You don’t know what will come next, so you have to be ready.', 'Having said that, I don’t think we are going to see a major war, but in these circumstances, you can never predict, and one little misunderstanding or miscalculation can lead to something major.', 'Al Jazeera: How do you see the role of third parties such as the US, China and Gulf States in this crisis, and how would you compare it with previous instances?', 'Yusuf:My last book, Brokering Peace (2018) was on the third-party management in Pakistan-India context, and this is such a vital element for both as they have internalised and built it into their calculus that a third-party country will inevitably come in.', 'The idea is that a third-party mediator will step in, and the two nations will agree to stop because that is what they really want, instead of escalating further.', 'And the leader of the pack of third-party countries is the United States since the Kargil war of 1999. (Pakistani forces crossed the LoC to try to take control of strategic heights in Ladakh’s Kargil, but India eventually managed to take back the territory. Then-US President Bill Clinton is credited with helping end that conflict.)', 'Everybody else, including China, ultimately backs the US position, which prioritises immediate de-escalation above all else during the crisis.', 'This changed somewhat in the 2016 surgical strikes and 2019 Pulwama crisis when the US leaned heavily on India’s side, perhaps unwittingly even emboldening them to act in 2019.', '(In 2016, Indian troops launched a cross-border “surgical strike” that New Delhi said targeted armed fighters planning to attack India, after gunmen killed 19 Indian soldiers in an attack on an army base in Uri, Indian-administered Kashmir. Three years later, Indian fighter jets bombed what New Delhi said were bases of “terrorists” in Balakot, in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, after the attack on the Indian military convoy in which 40 soldiers were killed. India and Pakistan then engaged in an aerial dogfight, and an Indian pilot was captured and subsequently returned.)', 'However, this time, you have a president in the White House who turned around and told both Pakistan and India to figure it out themselves.', 'This, I think, has hurt India more than Pakistan, because for Pakistan, they had discounted the possibility of significant US support in recent years, thinking they have gotten too close to India due to their strategic relationship.', 'But India would have been hoping for the Americans to put their foot down and pressure Pakistan, which did not exactly materialise. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s phone call again is playing down the middle, where they are telling both the countries to get out of war.', 'So, what they have done has, oddly enough, still played a role in holding India back so far, since India didn’t (so far) feel as emboldened to take action as they may have during Pulwama in 2019.', 'Gulf countries have played a more active role than before. China, too, has made a statement of restraint.', 'Al Jazeera: How has Pakistan’s relationship with India evolved in recent years?', 'Yusuf:There has been a sea change in the relationship between the two countries. When I was in office, despite serious problems and India’s unilateral moves in Kashmir in 2019, we saw a ceasefire agreement on the Line of Control as well as back-channel talks.', 'We have tried to move ahead and reduce India’s incentive to destabilise Pakistan, but I think India has lost that opportunity due to its own intransigence, hubris and an ideological bent that continues to force them to demean and threaten Pakistan.', 'That has led to a change in Pakistan as well, where the leadership is now convinced that the policy of restraint did not deliver, and India has misused and abused Pakistan’s offers for dialogue.', 'The view now is that if India doesn’t want to talk, Pakistan shouldn’t be pleading either. If India does reach out, we will likely respond, but there isn’t any desperation in Pakistan at all.', 'This is not a good place to be for either country. I have long believed and argued that ultimately for Pakistan to get to where we want to go economically, and for India to get to where it says it wants to go regionally, it cannot happen unless both improve their relationship. For now, though, with the current Indian attitude, unfortunately, I see little hope.', 'Al Jazeera: Do you anticipate any direct India-Pakistan talks at any level during or after this crisis?', 'Yes – I don’t know when it will be, or who will it be through or with, but I think one of the key lessons Indians could probably walk away with once all this is over is that attempting to isolate Pakistan isn’t working.', 'Indus Water Treaty in abeyance?Simla Agreement’spotential suspension? These are major decisions, and the two countries will need to talk to sort these out, and I think at some point in future they will engage.', 'But I also don’t think that Pakistan will make a move towards rapprochement, as we have offered opportunities for dialogues so many times recently to no avail. As I said, the mood in Pakistan has also firmed up on this question.', 'Ultimately, the Indians need to basically decide if they want to talk or not. If they come forth, I think Pakistan will still respond positively to it.', '*This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

Let them try this now,” Balji said.', 'Social media has emboldened Singaporeans to the point where the “fear factor” no longer exists, he said.', 'Bread-and-butter issues, along with the longstanding argument that more opposition voices are needed in Singapore, are also dominating in high-tech Singapore.', 'Cost-of-living concerns, exacerbated by a two-step rise in a goods and services tax (GST) – now at 9 percent – since 2023, have dominated the political debate.', 'In addition to previous handouts, authorities have already earmarked just under $1bn in handouts and rebates to help defray the cost of daily expenses, in the wake of a $4.9bn fiscal surplus for 2024.', 'But the larger-than-expected surplus led many to question the government’s need for the GST hike, with the main opposition Workers’ Party (WP) asserting that it had “turbocharged” inflation.', 'United States-imposed tariffs have also heightened economic unease.', 'Former WP lawmaker Leon Perera noted that with slowing economic growth in recent years, the claim of Singaporean exceptionalism is being cited less by the PAP.', '“Three generations of Singaporeans grew up with an exceptional leadership that delivered outcomes of a higher standard than other developed countries,” Perera said.', '“Now, increasingly, the narrative is that other developed countries are facing the same problems we have, be it inflation, sluggish real wage growth or high levels of inequality,” he said.', '“The PAP is at an inflection point because it is the transition to the new prime minister that I think is a catalyst for voters,” he added.', 'Former PAP lawmaker Inderjit Singh, who served for almost two decades in parliament, said previously people “saw their lives improve tremendously”, and, therefore, “people were willing to allow the government to play a dominant role” in their lives.', 'But Singh acknowledged that the cracks have been showing, with a cross-section of Singaporeans who feel they are “sliding backwards” in terms of the cost of living and the affordability of public housing.', '“The younger Singaporeans have had a good life, and they see the future as tougher than the present,” Singh said.', 'He also pointed to the “huge surge” of new immigrants at a rapid pace that has diluted national identity.', '“The fact that Singapore has remained a cohesive and prosperous nation should be a matter of pride for all Singaporeans,” he noted.', 'Neophyte Prime MinisterLawrence Wong, who came to power last May, is part of the current fourth generation of leaders, dubbed the “4G” leadership, which still lives under the shadow of the late, great Lee Kuan Yew.', '“One of the biggest issues for Singapore at 60 is leadership,” said Balji, who believes the current PAP leaders cannot be compared with Lee’s generation.', 'Judging by online chatter, many Singaporeans appear to agree.', 'A long-runningpublic dispute between Lee’s children, including Wong’s predecessor as PM Lee Hsien Loong, also continues to divide Singaporeans and generate international headlines. A high-profile corruption case that saw aformer transport minister jailedhas not helped matters.', 'Another point of contention for many: Singapore has the highest-paid ministers in the world, thanks to the PAP’s insistence that competitive salaries were essential for guarding against corruption.', 'At almost$1.69m per annum, Wong himself is the best-paid world leader. A junior minister gets about $845,000 while a backbencher is paid about $148,000.', 'Wong, who is also finance minister but was not the PAP’s first choice to succeed Lee, made his name as co-chair of the government’s COVID task force.', 'While the 52-year-old has enjoyed high approval ratings and there is little danger of the PAP losing power in this election, he is expected to improve on or maintain the party’s vote share of more than 61 percent from the last election in 2020 – which was one of its worst performances ever.', 'The PAP is also facing a resurgent opposition with a slate of young, highly credentialled WP candidates, and the governing party has looked rattled and vulnerable during the campaign.', 'The former PAP lawmaker Singh said that while Singapore’s management of the COVID pandemic was exemplary compared with many other countries, the jury is still out on Wong and his peers.', '“I think the 4G leaders have yet to show that they can handle these issues to the satisfaction of Singaporeans. Some of the trust in the PAP has eroded in the last 10 years or so,” he said.', '“Just saying ‘believe me’ will not be enough – showing a convincing plan that people can believe will be key,” he said.', '“If the PAP can do it, they should be able to win a good mandate.

Critics said this mandate was tantamount to Trump attempting to impose a political litmus test on the school.', 'By April 14, Harvard’s President Alan Garber had rejected the letter.

But his reported reappearance last month in the rebel-held Goma territory in DRC’s eastern Kivu region has led to speculation that he may have allied himself with the armed rebel group, M23.', 'His reappearance in DRC appears also to have angered the government, which has been battling the Rwanda-backed M23 group in a deadly conflict in the country’s east for months. Last week, the rebelsannounced a ceasefirefollowing mediation talks in Qatar.', 'Kambale Musavuli, a researcher at the Center for Research on Congo-Kinshasa, a think tank, said the DRC’s move to prosecute the ex-leader was a positive step.', '“Putting him on trial could be a pivotal moment for the DRC, not only in seeking justice for past crimes but also in breaking the cycle of impunity that has plagued our leadership since independence,” he said.', 'Joseph Kabila, 53, is a former military officer who was fourth president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 2001 to 2019. Although his term was supposed to end in 2016, he controversially delayed elections until huge protests broke out. Presidents in the DRC are elected for a five-year term and are only permitted to serve two terms. A new constitution, adopted in 2006, reset Kabila’s two-term tenure.', 'He took over leadership of the country in 2001 at the age of just 29, after his father and former coup leader, President Laurent Kabila, was assassinated. DRC presidents, former presidents and senators are immune from prosecution unless they commit “gross misconduct” according to the country’s constitution.', 'Kabila’s relationship with President Tshisekedi, a former opposition leader of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS), is fraught. Although the two men agreed in 2019 to an awkward power-sharing pact that allowed members of Kabila’s People’s Party for Reconstruction and Democracy (PPRD) to take part in the new government, they clashed over who could appoint which officials to office. Their alliance broke down a year later, in 2020.', 'Tensions were also mounting over the M23 rebellion which began in 2012. Kabila has accused Tshisekedi of failing to tackle the matter with tact, complaining that the president has relied on external mediation rather than engaging in direct dialogue with the rebels.', 'In a recent opinion piece in South Africa’s Sunday Times, Kabila wrote that under Tshisekedi, the DRC “is close to imploding as a result of the civil war”. He also accused the president of attempting to hang onto power, referring to Tshisekedi’s plans to push for a constitutional review. Tshisekedi said in 2023 his government would review the constitution and leave the matter of term limits “for the people to decide”, without expanding further.', 'Kabila has held talks with opposition leaders, including Moise Katumbi, leader of the Together for the Republic party, although it is unclear what was discussed. Observers say Kabila\\xa0is angling to act as a lead negotiator between M23 and Kinshasa, but he has not publicly made that claim himself.', 'For his part, Tshisekedi blames Kabila for undermining his government and accuses him of supporting M23, citing his close links to former election chairman-turned-rebel-leader, Corneille Nangaa.', 'Nangaa, who declared his alliance with the rebels in 2023, was head of the country’s electoral commission from 2015 to 2021 and oversaw the disputed 2018 elections that brought Tshisekedi into office. The two later fell out over how the elections were run, causing Nangaa to publicly criticise Tshisekedi and eventually join a rebel group.', 'On April 20, the DRC’s government suspended Kabila’s party, PPRD, and ordered his assets to be seized on charges of supporting M23. It is not clear if those assets are yet under state control.', 'DRC Justice Minister Constant Mutamba told reporters on Wednesday that the state has amassed evidence implicating Kabila in “war crimes, crimes against humanity and massacres of peaceful civilians and military personnel” in the country’s east. He did not give specific details of these crimes.', 'Swaths of the eastern region are currently under control of the M23 group, which seeks control of mineral wealth and has ambitions to take power in Kinshasa. The United Nations and United States claim the group isbacked by neighbouring Rwanda.', 'In relation to this, Kabila is accused of “treason, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and participation in an insurrectional movement”, the justice minister said.', 'It’s not clear when the Senate will approve the army’s demand, or when a trial might begin.', 'The M23 armed group is the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of eastern DRC’s trillions of dollars in mineral wealth, critical for the production of much of the world’s technology.', 'According to UN experts and the US, M23 rebels are supported by about 4,000 soldiers from neighbouring Rwanda.', 'Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame has not explicitly denied supporting the group.In February, he told a CNN reporter he did “not know” if Rwandan troops had boots on the ground in the DRC.', 'The group, which is largely composed of Tutsi fighters, says it wants to protect Congolese Tutsis of Rwandan origin from discrimination and wants to transform the DRC from a failed state into a modern one, though critics say this is a pretext for Rwanda’s involvement.', 'Many M23 members were indeed former ethnic Tutsi rebels who integrated into the DRC army following the Congo Wars (1996-2003) but later defected, citing discrimination and broken peace deals.', 'Those wars had roots in the 1994 Rwandan genocide of minority Tutsis and centrist Hutus. Thousands of genocidaires fled over the border into refugee camps in the DRC following the fall of the Hutu government, and from there, launched attacks on Rwanda. That conflict led to fighting in an already unstable DRC.', 'President Kagame’s government, meanwhile, accuses the DRC of enlisting remnant Hutu forces in the form of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), which fights alongside the Congolese army.', 'In a previous uprising in 2012, M23 briefly seized Goma, a strategic regional hub, but withdrew after international pressure.', 'Since January, the group, which analysts say is eyeing political power this time, has again captured Goma as well as Bukavu, a city of 1.3 million people. At least 3,000 people were reported killed and thousands displaced in the Goma fighting in January.', 'Kabila has not responded to the DRC government’s recent allegations or its moves to prosecute him. However, his allies have criticised these moves. Ferdinand Kambere, a senior member of Kabila’s PPRD, said Kinshasa’s actions were a “relentless persecution” of the former president.', '“For us, these mistakes that those in power keep making against the former president, thinking they are humiliating or intimidating him, actually show that the regime is nearing its end. They have nothing left to use against Kabila,” Kambere told The Associated Press news agency.', 'But some say the move is necessary for justice. Kabila’s reported appearance in Goma should not be seen as a coincidence, Musavuli, the researcher, said, but rather indicates that he may be shoring up alliances or defying Kinshasa. Kabila and any others implicated in crimes\\xa0should be tried, he said.', '“His regime is deeply implicated in enabling armed groups, particularly in the east. Many of these crimes occurred under his watch, if not with his direct complicity, certainly with his strategic silence. The people want a transparent and credible judicial process, one that doesn’t just scapegoat one individual but exposes the broader networks of power, both domestic and international, that have profited from the suffering of the Congolese people,” he added.', 'Meanwhile, an opposition alliance against President Tshisekedi is forming. On Thursday, opposition leaders Moise Katumbi, Martin Fayulu and Delly Sesanga, together with Kabila, issued a joint call for national dialogue in what looked like a united front.', 'In a statement, they questioned the strength of the Qatar-led ceasefire deal and instead called for a return to Congolese-led mediation mechanisms, including one being led by the country’s Catholic Church leaders, to deal with the “root causes” of the crisis, among them “bad governance”.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

Since gaining independence from British rule in 1947, both countries have controlled parts of Kashmir – with China controlling another part of it – but continue to claim it in full.', 'So what is the Kashmir conflict all about, and why do India and Pakistan continue to fight over it nearly eight decades after independence?', 'India has implied it believes Pakistan may have indirectly supported the Pahalgam attack – a claim Pakistan strongly denies. Both countries have engaged in tit-for-tat diplomatic swipes at each other, including cancelling visas for each other’s citizens and recalling diplomatic staff.', 'India has suspended its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty, a water use and distribution agreement with Pakistan. Pakistan has in turn threatened to walk away from theSimla Agreement, which was signed in July 1972, seven months after Pakistan decisively lost the 1971 war that led to the creation of Bangladesh. The Simla Agreement has since formed the bedrock of India-Pakistan relations. It governs the LoC and outlines a commitment to resolve disputes through peaceful means.', 'OnWednesday, United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar to urge both countries to work together to “de-escalate tensions and maintain peace and security in South Asia”.', 'US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also called Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday to condemn the attack. “I offered my strong support. We stand with India and its great people,” Hegseth wrote on X.', 'Situated in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent, the region spans 222,200 square kilometres (85,800sq miles) with about four million people living in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and 13 million in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir.', 'The population is overwhelmingly Muslim. Pakistan controls the northern and western portions, namely Azad Kashmir, Gilgit and Baltistan, while India controls the southern and southeastern parts, including the Kashmir Valley and its biggest city, Srinagar, as well as Jammu and Ladakh.', 'The end of British colonial rule and the partition of British India in August 1947 led to the creation of Muslim-majority Pakistan and Hindu-majority India.', 'At the time, princely states like Jammu and Kashmir were given the option to accede to either country. With a nearly 75 percent Muslim population, many in Pakistan believed the region would naturally join that country. After all, Pakistan under Muhammad Ali Jinnah was created as a homeland for Muslims, even though a majority of Muslims in what remained as India after partition stayed back in that country, where Mahatma Gandhi and independent India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, built the foundations of a secular state.', 'The maharaja of Kashmir initially sought independence from both countries but later chose to join India after Pakistan invaded, triggering the first war from 1947 to 1948. The ceasefire line established after that was formalised as the LoC in the Simla Agreement.', 'Despite this, both countries continue to assert claims to the entire region, including, in the case of India, to China-administered Aksai Chin on the eastern side.', 'The ruling Hindu maharaja of Kashmir was Hari Singh, whose forefathers took control of the region as part of an agreement with the British in 1846.', 'At the time of partition, Singh\\xa0initially sought to retain Kashmir’s independence from both India and Pakistan.', 'But by then, a rebellion against his rule by pro-Pakistani residents in a part of Kashmir had broken out. Armed groups from Pakistan, backed by the government of the newly formed country, invaded and\\xa0tried to take over the region.', 'Sheikh Abdullah, the most prominent Kashmiri leader at the time, opposed the Pakistani-backed attack. Hari Singh appealed to India for military assistance.', 'Nehru’s government intervened against Pakistan – but on the condition that the maharaja sign an Instrument of Accession merging Jammu and Kashmir with India. In October 1947, Jammu and Kashmir officially became part of India, giving New Delhi control over the Kashmir Valley, Jammu and Ladakh.', 'India accused Pakistan of being the aggressor in the conflict – a charge Pakistan denied – and took the matter to the United Nations in January 1948. A key resolution was passed stating: “The question of the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India or Pakistan should be decided through the democratic method of a free and impartial plebiscite.” Nearly 80 years later, no plebiscite has been held – a source of grievance for Kashmiris.', 'The first war over Kashmir finally ended with a UN-mediated ceasefire, and in 1949, the two countries formalised a ceasefire line under an agreement signed in Karachi, Pakistan’s then-capital. The new line divided Kashmir between Indian- and Pakistani-controlled parts.', 'By 1953, Sheikh Abdullah had founded the Jammu Kashmir National Conference (JKNC) and won state elections in Indian-administered Kashmir.', 'However, his increasing interest in seeking independence from India led to his arrest by Indian authorities. In 1956, Jammu and Kashmir was declared an “integral” part of India.', 'In September 1965, less than two decades after independence, India and Pakistan went to war over the region again.', 'Pakistan hoped to aid the Kashmiri cause and incite a local uprising, but the war ended in a stalemate, with both sides agreeing to a UN-supervised ceasefire.', 'The Aksai Chin region in the northeast of the region sits at an elevation of 5,000 metres (16,400 feet), and through history, was a hard-to-reach, barely inhabited territory that in the 19th and early 20th centuries sat at the border of British India and China.', 'It was a part of the kingdom that Kashmir’s Hari Singh inherited as a result of the 1846 deal with the British. Until the 1930s, at least, Chinese maps too recognised Kashmir as being south of the Ardagh-Johnson Line that marked the northeastern boundary of Kashmir.', 'After 1947 and Singh’s accession to India, New Delhi viewed Aksai Chin as part of its territory. But by the early 1950s, China – now under communist rule – built a massive 1,200km (745-mile) long highway connecting Tibet and Xinjiang, and running through Aksai Chin.', 'India was caught unaware – the desolate region had not been a security priority until then. In 1954, Nehru called for the border to be formalised according to the Ardagh-Johnson Line – in effect, recognising Aksai Chin as a part of India.', 'But China insisted that the British had never discussed the Ardagh-Johnson Line, and that Aksai Chin belonged to it under an alternate map. Most importantly, though, China already had boots on the ground in Aksai Chin because of the highway.', 'Meanwhile, Pakistan and China also had differences over who controlled what in parts of Kashmir. But by the early 1960s, they reached an agreement: China gave up grazing grounds that Pakistan had sought, and in return, Pakistan ceded a thin slice of northern Kashmir to China.', 'India claims this deal was illegal since, according to the Instrument of Accession of 1947, all of Kashmir belonged to it.', 'Another war followed in December 1971 – this time over what was then known as East Pakistan, following a popular revolt by India-backed Bengali nationalists against Pakistan’s rule. The war led to the creation of Bangladesh. More than 90,000 Pakistani soldiers were captured by India as prisoners of war.', 'The Simla Agreement converted the ceasefire line into the LoC, a de facto but not internationally recognised border, yet again leaving Kashmir’s status in question.', 'But after India’s decisive 1971 victory and amid the growing political influence of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi – Nehru’s daughter – the 1970s saw Abdullah abandon his demand for a plebiscite and the Kashmiri people’s right of self-determination.', 'In 1975, he signed an accord with Gandhi, recognising India-administered Kashmir’s accession to India while retaining semi-autonomous status under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution. He later served as the region’s chief minister.', 'As ties grew between Abdullah’s National Conference Party and India’s ruling Indian National Congress, so did frustration among Kashmiris in India-controlled Kashmir, who felt that socioeconomic conditions had not improved in the region.', 'Separatist groups like the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, founded by Maqbool Bhat, rose.', 'India’s claims of democracy in Kashmir faltered in the face of growing support for the armed groups. A tipping point was the 1987 election to the state legislature, which saw Abdullah’s son, Farooq Abdullah, come to power, but which was widely viewed as heavily rigged to keep out popular, anti-India politicians.', 'Indian authorities launched a severe crackdown on separatist groups, which New Delhi alleged were supported and trained by Pakistan’s military intelligence. Pakistan, for its part, has consistently maintained it provides only moral and diplomatic support, backing the Kashmiris’ “right to self-determination”.', 'In 1999, conflict erupted in Kargil, where Indian and Pakistani forces fought for control over strategic heights along the LoC. India eventually regained the lost territory, and the pre-conflict status quo was restored. This was the third war over Kashmir – Kargil is a part of Ladakh.', 'The following years saw a gradual reduction in direct conflict, with multiple ceasefires signed. However, India significantly ramped up its military presence in the valley.', 'Tensions were reignited in 2016 after the killing of Burhan Wani, a popular separatist figure. His death led to a rise in violence in the valley and more frequent exchanges of fire along the LoC.', 'Major attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir, including those in Pathankot and Uri in 2016, targeted Indian forces, who blamed Pakistan-backed armed groups.', 'The most serious escalation came in February 2019 when a convoy of Indian paramilitary personnel was attacked in Pulwama, killing 40 soldiers and bringing the two nations to the brink of war.', 'Six months later, the Indian government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi unilaterally abrogated Article 370, stripping Jammu and Kashmir of its semi-autonomous status. Pakistan condemned the move as a violation of the Simla Agreement.', 'The decision led to widespread protests in the valley. India deployed 500,000 to 800,000 soldiers, placed the region under lockdown, shut down internet services and detained thousands of people.', 'India insists that Pakistan is to blame for the ongoing crisis in Kashmir. It accuses Pakistan of hosting, financing and training the Pakistan-based armed groups that have claimed responsibility for multiple attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir over the decades. Some of these groups are also accused by India, the US, and others of attacking other parts of India – such as during the 2008 attack on Mumbai, India’s financial capital, when at least 166 people were killed over three days.', 'Pakistan continues to deny that it fuels violence in India-controlled Kashmir and instead points to widespread resentment among locals, accusing India of imposing harsh and undemocratic rule in the region. Islamabad says it only supports Kashmiri separatism diplomatically and morally.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

Pakistan’s latest trade ban against India includes trading through third countries, which means the authorities in Pakistan are also well aware of this informal trade.', 'Preventing it could be tricky, however, as rerouting and relabelling goods in third countries are carried out by private entities, including importers, exporters and traders, and not through official government channels, according to Singh.', '“It is really for the customs agencies in Pakistan to determine whether the relevant nonpreferential rules of origin, if any, in Pakistan are met,” Singh said.', '“This is usually done through some sort of provision of proof that the importer of the product has to provide to satisfy the requirements that may be there in the law in Pakistan. So this is a question for the authorities in Pakistan to determine whether the good is actually originating in the third country or is it in fact a circumvented good which is coming from India.”', 'The challenge now is for customs authorities in Pakistan to determine how to tackle this circumvention through third countries, Singh said.', '“That would require them, to some extent, to increase the scrutiny of the goods which are coming into Pakistan.”', 'Ultimately, it will be hard to prevent this trade because it meets demand. “This trade is bound to happen because [India and Pakistan] have common cultures.

Its critical minerals include precious and non-ferrous metals, ferroalloys and minerals such as titanium, zirconium, graphite and lithium.', 'Ukrainealso holds reserves of rare earth elements (REEs), a group of 17 metallic minerals including lanthanum, cerium and neodymium, essential for high-tech applications in electronics, defence, aerospace and renewable energy.', 'According to the United Nations’ Russian-language news service, Ukraine’s critical mineral reserves made up approximately 5 percent of the global supply as of 2022.', 'Ukraine also accounts for 7 percent of the global production of titanium.', 'Its lithium reserves are largely untapped and considered one of Europe’s largest, at an estimated 500,000 tonnes.', 'Al Jazeera’s Rosiland Jordan said the deal can be viewed as a “diplomatic win” for Ukraine.', 'This is largely because Trump had initially insisted that Ukraine must pay back the $350bn he claims the administration of his predecessor, Joe Biden, had spent on the country since the start of the war with Russia.', '“Now, [repaying that amount] was something that the Ukrainians did not want to do, and over the past couple of months, they’ve pushed to get that removed from the deal,” Jordan commented from Washington, DC. “So in a way, it can be viewed as a significant victory for Ukraine that this deal is, as some are putting it, a forward-looking deal, and not one that is looking back to the previous prosecution and financing of Ukraine’s war against Russia.”', 'Other analysts also noted that while the negotiations began with the US’s desire for access to Ukraine’s minerals, they have since morphed into a broader investment fund for Ukraine’s reconstruction.', '“Ukraine seems to have pulled off some seriously tough negotiating with the Trump administration,” wrote Shelby Magid, the deputy director of the Eurasia Center in the Atlantic Council, a US-based think tank. “Past proposals from Washington reportedly saw the United States taking partial or total ownership of broad swaths of Ukraine’s natural resources and infrastructure… Now, Ukraine retains full ownership of its assets and has turned the deal into a joint investment fund toward the country’s future reconstruction, with only future – not past – US assistance to Ukraine counting as a contribution to the fund.”', 'No. However, under pressure from the US to make peace with Russia, President Zelenskyy has insisted that Ukraine will not enter peace talks until it has security guarantees against another war occurring in the future.', 'While the US-Ukraine minerals deal does not include such guarantees, analysts say it reopens the door to military assistance from Washington to Kyiv.', '“It’s not a security guarantee,” said Anatol Lieven, the director of the Eurasia Program at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. “This does not say – and Trump would never offer – to send US troops to defend Ukraine, and Trump has refused to back up European proposals to send European troops to Ukraine. But what it does if it’s implemented … it ensures that the US will remain interested in Ukraine,” he told Al Jazeera.', 'Lieven said the deal means the US “will feel it has a stake in Ukraine”.', '“And although that’s not a security guarantee, it certainly ought to be a deterrent to future Russian aggression, because it would mean that if the Russians did launch a new war, the US would certainly impose severe sanctions and would aid Ukraine militarily,” he added.', 'While the Ukrainian cabinet has approved the agreement, it still needs to be ratified by the parliament.', 'But more importantly, Lieven said, there needs to be peace for the deal to take effect.', '“This is about private investment. The money that goes into Ukraine to develop these minerals will be private. It won’t be US state money. And of course that raises the question of whether private investors will actually see an economic motive to invest, especially given the risks involved,” he said.', '“So I think this is more of a diplomatic win for Ukraine. It’s not necessarily an economic win for Ukraine.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

Xi is stoking ‘fanatic nationalism’.', 'Taipei, Taiwan –Taiwan has faith in the support of the United States, a top Taiwanese official has said, despite widespread concern on the island that US President Donald Trump could use the East Asian democracy as a bargaining chip in its dealings with China.', '“Taiwan and the US have a very strong and solid relationship, and Taiwan has cross-party support from the US Congress,” Mainland Affairs Council Minister Chiu Chui-cheng said in an exclusive interview with Al Jazeera.', 'Unlike the US and China, “the US and Taiwan have unprecedentedly close relations,” said Chiu, whose cabinet-level portfolio covers Taiwan’s relations with mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau.', 'Still, Chiu said it was still too early to fully assess the impact of the second Trump administration.', '“The Taiwan government will continue to observe the Trump administration since it has been less than three months,” he said through an interpreter.', '“Taiwan’s government has a very consistent position of protecting our sovereignty, our freedom and democracy.”', 'Trump made headlines in Taiwan in 2016 when, as president-elect, he accepted a congratulatory phone call from then-Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, overturning longstanding diplomatic convention.', 'The US, like most countries, does not have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, which China considers part of its territory.', 'Ties between the US and Taiwan continued to deepen throughout Trump’s first term and under former US President Joe Biden, with numerous delegations of Democratic and Republican lawmakers visiting the island in recent years.', 'Since returning to the White House, however, Trump has a launched a series of broadsides at the island, although US Secretary of State Marco Rubio remains a firm Taiwan supporter.', 'The US president has varyingly accused Taiwan of stealing the US chip industry, argued that Taipei should pay for its own defence, and threatened top Taiwanese chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) with a “100 percent tax” if it does not expand US-based manufacturing.', 'Trump also hit Taiwan with a 32 percent “reciprocal” tariff – which has been paused until July – and expanded existing steel and aluminium tariffs on its exports, among other initiatives.', 'But Washington is committed to supporting the island’s defence under a 1979 law, though the legislation does not specify an obligation to directly intervene in a conflict.', 'While Taipei is taking a wait-and-see approach, Trump’s “America First” rhetoric and politics have raised concern among many Taiwanese that he could abandon Taiwan to win concessions in trade talks with China.', 'In a survey published by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation in March, just 39.2 percent of respondents said they believe the US would send troops to defend Taiwan, down from an all-time high of 65 percent in 2021.', 'Despite these fears, Chiu said he believes that Washington would never accept an “unreasonable request” from Beijing to alter the terms of its relationship with Taiwan.', 'China has pledged to “reunify” Taiwan with the Chinese mainland, by force if necessary, although the ruling Communist Party has never directly controlled the island.', 'Chiu said Taiwan has much to offer the US, from its strategic position within Washington’s first island chain defence strategy aimed at checking Chinese expansion in the Pacific, to its position as the world’s foremost chipmaker.', '“We think that we can demonstrate to the US people and to the US people that Taiwan is a very good partner, and we are irreplaceable,” Chiu said.', 'Chiu’s cabinet-level portfolio oversees the planning and implementation of Taiwan’s cross-strait policy, although Beijing has been officially incommunicado with Taipei since the Democratic Progressive Party took power in 2016.', 'Beijing considers the DPP “separatists” and has ramped up military, economic and diplomatic pressure on the island over the past nine years.', 'Chiu said that Taiwan’s government continues to try to communicate with Beijing through official channels, as well as liaising through intermediaries from the business world, nonprofit sector and academia.', 'Chiu, however, criticised China’s communications with the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), which he characterised as part of Beijing’s divide and rule and “United Front” tactics employed against Taiwan.', 'The term “United Front” refers to both an official department of the Chinese Communist Party and activities carried out by party members to promote the CCP agenda – including convincing Taiwan’s 23.4 million citizens that unification with China is both inevitable and desirable, despite polling showing most Taiwanese favour the status quo of de facto independence.', '“We are constantly facing United Front tactics, infiltration and division in Taiwanese society. They are everywhere,” Chiu said.', 'Taiwan’s National Security Bureau reported that 64 people were charged with espionage in 2024 – primarily active members of the military and veterans – up from 48 in 2023 and 10 in 2022.', 'Other threats are more immediately obvious, Chiu said, such as the escalation of Chinese military exercises and manoeuvres near Taiwan over the past five years.', 'China launched more than 5,000 military flights in the direction of Taiwan in 2024 alone, Chiu said, including about 3,000 that crossed the “median line” of the Taiwan Strait – an unofficial border dividing the strategic waterway between China and Taiwan.', 'Beijing also sent more than 2,500 warships in the direction of Taiwan, with some entering its contiguous waters, he said, referring to the zone that is adjacent to the territorial sea and extends a maximum of 24 nautical miles (44km) from shore.', 'Chiu said he was most concerned about the leadership style of Chinese President Xi Jinping.', 'Xi, who is serving a third term as president after eliminating presidential term limits in 2018, is widely viewed as the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, the founder of modern China.', '“The Xi regime is a new type of authoritarianism. He has been inciting a fanatic nationalism, and that’s why we are seeing military hegemony and wolf warrior diplomacy,” Chiu said.', '“Mainland China right now is not a very rational decision-making party, and this nationalism poses a great threat to its neighbouring countries,” Chiu said.', '“If you ask me what concerns me the most, I would say that it’s the essence of the Xi regime,” he said.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

Black swaths of burned earth checkerboard the rolling hills — evidence of the fires that have increased along with the temperature.', 'Yet enter the village of Pradinho, and a verdant patchwork emerges. Here, lush banana palms, cassava plants and guava trees sprout from the dry plains.', 'These flourishing lots are the product of Hāmhi Terra Viva, an Indigenous-led agroforestry project in the eastern state of Minas Gerais where ancestral songs and traditions are woven into the planting process.', 'Each oasis of trees, cultivated in backyard plots or large reforestation areas, signals a kind of rebirth for the local Maxakali people, also known as the Tikmũ’ũn.', 'The Atlantic Forest, a complex ecosystem of rainforests, coastal broadleaf trees and mangroves, used to cover the Maxakali territory. Its dense canopy trapped in moisture and fostered one of the most biodiverse regions in the world.', 'But the destruction of the Atlantic Forest has exacerbated the local effects of climate change — and with it, heightened the risks of wildfires.', 'In Brazil, the Jequitinhonha Valley, where the four Maxakali territories are located, has suffered a dramatic rise in temperatures in recent years.', 'Twenty Brazilian cities registered temperatures five degrees Celsius (nine degrees Fahrenheit) higher than the average daily maximum, according to 2023 governmentdataanalysed by the newspaper O Globo. Of those cities, 18 were in the Jequitinhonha Valley.', 'The city of Araçuaí even shattered the record for the hottest temperature in Brazil’s history in November of that year, with thermometers rising to 44.8 degrees Celsius — or 112.6 degrees Fahrenheit. It lies a mere 130km (81 miles) from Maxakali territory.', '“We are in the epicentre of the climate crisis in Brazil,” said Rosângela Pereira de Tugny, coordinator of the Hāmhi project.', 'More than 85 percent of the Atlantic Forest has been destroyed, as agriculture, development and practices like logging encroach upon its land. In Minas Gerais, experts estimate, less than eight percent of the forest remains.', '“When I was a kid, there was lots of forest,” said Lúcio Flávio Maxakali, a schoolteacher and a master’s degree student at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. “There were lots of animals and we planted food — corn, beans, sugarcane — in the middle of the woods.”', 'But over the centuries, colonial settlers used fire to clear vast tracts of the Atlantic Forest. Farmers often seeded the burned areas with guinea grass, brought from Africa, to feed their cattle.', '“The farmers changed the landscape,” said Manuel Damásio Maxakali, the 52-year-old leader of Pradinho village.', 'His wrinkled hands drawing makeshift maps in the dusty earth, Damásio was eager to communicate the destruction that the farmers wrought. “They burned everything. They added fences. They added cattle. They cut down everything. Each time, the farmers took more land.”', \"Brazil's dictatorship, from 1964 to 1985, set the stage for even greater destruction of the region's tropical forests.\", 'Governed by the motto \"integrate to not surrender\", the military leadership cut roadways through dense forest and pushed for development projects in remote regions to stimulate economic growth.', 'Deforestation ultimately hit a peak in the period between 1995 and 2004, when as much as 27,772 square kilometres (10,723 square miles) of forest in Brazil were destroyed per year.', 'That, in turn, increased temperatures across the country. In the region of the Atlantic Forest in particular, onestudyfound that the surface temperature of a hectare increased by one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) whenever a quarter of its tree cover was razed.', 'If the entire hectare of forest was demolished, the study said, temperatures could spike by four degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit).', 'Without the moist tree cover, experts say the Maxakali territory has grown hotter and drier. That increases the likelihood of wildfires sparking.', 'Last year even broke a record for the number of wildfires in Minas Gerais. In less than nine months,24,475wildfires were tallied — far exceeding the previous record high in the whole of 2021.', 'Scarce rainfall also heightens the risk of fires, as does the seemingly endless guinea grass, which creates a thick carpet of flammable material across the landscape.', 'Grass fires can spread four times as quickly as forest fires, leading the Maxakali to nickname the invasive plant “kerosene”.', 'Some blazes are started accidentally within the Maxakali communities themselves.', 'Fire, after all, is a frequent part of Maxakali death rites, which often involve the burning of the deceased’s clothing, tools and house, and it is also used for cooking and to clear areas of snakes.', 'But wildfires are not the only consequence of the changing climate. The river in the village of Pradinho has shrunk so much that villagers are unable to bathe.', '“There’s no water. The water has dried up,” Damásio explained. “We normally use water from the river, but there’s nothing now.”', 'Maxakali territory once spanned at least three large valleys in the Atlantic Forest. Elders in the village remember how the forest supplied food, medicine and construction materials — in addition to serving as habitat for the yãmĩyxop, spiritual beings central to Maxakali beliefs.', '“There were medicines in the forest for us,” explained Damásio. “When we had stomachaches, we would use the bark from the trees to feel better. But now, it’s just grass. The farmers burned everything.”', 'But the four remaining Maxakali reservations — reduced to 6,434 hectares (15,900 acres) of pasture — contain less than 17 percent of their original vegetation. Some experts consider the Atlantic Forest to be regionally extinct.', 'That absence has many Maxakali leaders turning to reforestation — and finding in their musical traditions an ecological blueprint of the past.', 'Singing organises life in Maxakali villages: Music, for instance, is used to cure illness, teach history or transmit practical instructions, like how to make bags or weave fishing nets.', '“Songs tie together the whole Tikmũ’ũn social structure,” said de Tugny, the Hāmhi project coordinator, who is also a musicologist at the Federal University of Southern Bahia. “People don’t compose songs. They have songs.”', 'To have a song, she added, means being capable of taking care of the spirit considered to be the song’s creator.', 'Ancestral songs also provide an extremely detailed register of local ecology. Twelve musical canons, distinct in grammar and lexicon, total about 360 hours of song. Contained in the lyrics are hundreds of species of flora and fauna now extinct in the territory.', '“We sing about everything: the saplings, the bananas, ourselves,” explained Manuel Kelé, leader of the village of Água Boa. “Even dogs have a song within our religion.”', \"One song, for example, lists 33 species of bees, some of which don’t have names in Brazil's national language, Portuguese, and only two of which are currently present in the territory. The lyrics supply information about bee behaviour that many Maxakali have never witnessed first-hand.\", '“The songs are snapshots,” said de Tugny. “They are like photographs of every detail that exists in the Atlantic Forest: the names of insects, birds, plants, moments of relationship between an animal and a leaf. All these are registered.”', \"For the Maxakali, ritual songs also play a crucial role in helping the forest regenerate. Singing is a daily part of their work in Hāmhi's tree nurseries.\", 'Nursery caretakers not only sing to seeds as they are buried, but they also make music as part of the regular rhythms of harvesting and cultivation. Caretakers divide into groups, position themselves around the nursery, and sing in concert with each other. The song lyrics help participants remember the ecological knowledge of their ancestors.', \"And while some of the work at Hāmhi is dedicated to planting fruit trees and other crops, the project's leaders see reforestation as key to reducing the region's fire risks.\", 'Since its inception in 2023, the Hāmhi project has planted over 60 hectares (148 acres) of fruit trees and 155 hectares (383 acres) of Atlantic Forest vegetation. The goal is a reforested area nearly twice that size.', 'Programme participants have also organised themselves into a provisional fire brigade and even created natural fire barriers, using traditional methods like planting species of fire-resistant vegetation.', '“Songs help the forest grow,” said Damásio, the village leader. “We ask those who have died to help us. They walk here and assist us. We are calling on the forest to grow back.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

While India has alleged Pakistan’s involvement in the Pahalgam attack, Islamabad has denied this claim.', 'India and Pakistan each administer parts of Kashmir, but both countries claim the territory in full.', 'Tarar’s statement came a day after Modi gave the Indian military “complete operational freedom” to respond to the Pahalgam attack in a closed-door meeting with the country’s security leaders, multiple news agencies reported, citing anonymous senior government sources.', 'On Wednesday, Modi chaired a Cabinet Committee on Security meeting, the second such meeting since the Pahalgam attack, state-run Doordarshan television reported.', 'Meanwhile, as the neighbours continued to\\xa0exchangegunfirealong the Line of Control (LoC) dividing Indian and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, other world leaders stepped up diplomacy to calm tensions.', '“We are reaching out to both parties, and telling … them to not escalate the situation,” a United States state department spokesperson told reporters on Tuesday, quoting US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is expected to speak to the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan.', 'Also on Tuesday, the spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that he had spoken to Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, offering his help in “de-escalation”.', 'While it is unclear what course of action India could take, it has in the past used a range of military tactics. Here are some of them:', 'By design, they aren’t announced – and aren’t confirmed. But over the decades, India and Pakistan have each launched multiple covert raids into territory controlled by the other, targeting military posts, killing soldiers – and on occasion beheading the enemy’s troops.', 'These strikes are often carried out as a retaliatory step by a military unit whose personnel were themselves previously attacked, as a form of retribution.', 'But such raids are never confirmed: The idea is to send the other country a message but not force it to respond, thereby containing the risk of escalation. Public announcements lead to domestic pressure on governments to hit back.', 'Sometimes, though, the idea is not to send subtle messages – but to embarrass the other country by making an attack public. It also doesn’t hurt politically.', 'India has in the past carried out so-called surgical strikes against specific, chosen targets across the LoC – most recently in 2016.', 'Then, after armed fighters killed 17 Indian soldiers in Uri, Indian-administered Kashmir, special forces of the Indian Army crossed the de facto border to attack “launch pads” from where, New Delhi alleged, “terrorists” were planning to strike India again. “The operations were basically focused to ensure that these terrorists do not succeed in their design of infiltration and carrying out destruction and endangering the lives of citizens of our country,” Lieutenant General Ranbir Singh, then the director-general of military operations for the Indian Army, said in apublic statement, revealing the raid.', 'India claimed that the surgical strike had killed dozens of fighters, though independent analysts believe the toll was likely much lower.', 'In February 2019, a suicide bomber killed 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers in Pulwama in Indian-administered Kashmir, weeks before national elections in the country. This attack was claimed by theJaish-e-Muhammad, an armed group based in Pakistan.', 'Amid an outpouring of rage, the Indian Air Force launched an aerial raid into Pakistan-administered Kashmir. India claimed it had struck hideouts of “terrorists” and killed several dozen fighters.', 'Pakistan insisted that Indian jets only hit a forested region, and did not kill any fighters. Islamabad claimed it scrambled jets that chased Indian planes back across the LoC.', 'But a day later, Indian and Pakistani fighter jets again engaged in a dogfight – this one ending with Pakistan downing an Indian plane inside territory it controls. An Indian fighter pilot was captured, and returned a few days later.', 'Over the past few years, there have been growing calls in India that New Delhi should take back Pakistan-administered Kashmir. That chorus has only sharpened in recent days after the Pahalgam attack, with even leaders of the opposition Congress Party goading the Modi government to take back that territory.', 'While retaking Pakistan-administered Kashmir remains a policy objective of every Indian government, the closely matched military capabilities of both sides make such an endeavour unlikely.', 'Still, India has a track record of successfully taking disputed territory from Pakistan.', 'In 1984, the Indian Army and Indian Air Force launchedOperation Meghdoot, in which they rapidly captured the Siachen glacier in the Himalayas, blocking the Pakistan Army from accessing key passes. One of the world’s largest non-polar glaciers, Siachin has since been the planet’s highest battleground, with Indian and Pakistani military outposts positioned against each other.', 'In the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, the Indian Navy announced that it had carried out test missile strikes.', '“Indian Navy ships undertook successful multiple anti-ship firings to revalidate and demonstrate readiness of platforms, systems and crew for long range precision offensive strike,” the navy said in a statement on April 27.', '“Indian Navy stands combat ready, credible and future ready in safeguarding the nation’s maritime interests anytime, anywhere, anyhow.”', 'Many analysts have suggested that the trials were a show of strength, pointing to the Indian Navy’s ability to strike Pakistani territory if ordered to do so.', 'India and Pakistan have gone to war four times in the 78 years of their independent existence. Three of these armed conflicts have been over Kashmir.', 'Two months after the British colonial government left the subcontinent in August 1947 after carving it up into India and Pakistan, the neighbours fought their first war over Kashmir, then ruled by a king.', 'Pakistani militias invaded Kashmir to try and take control. The king, Hari Singh, pleaded with India for help. New Delhi agreed, and joined the war against Pakistan, but on the condition that Singh sign an instrument of accession, merging Kashmir with India. The king agreed.', 'The war finally ended on January 1, 1949, with a ceasefire agreement. India and Pakistan have both held parts of Kashmir since then.', 'In 1965, a clash between their border forces escalated into a full-blown war. Pakistani forces crossed the ceasefire line into Indian-administered Kashmir, while Indian forces crossed the international border into Pakistan’s Lahore and launched attacks. After thousands of casualties on both sides, a United Nations Security Council resolution helped the neighbours end the war.', 'In 1971, Pakistan and India were embroiled in an armed conflict over East Pakistan, where Indian forces helped liberate the territory, leading to the establishment of Bangladesh. In 1972, the two countries signed theSimla Agreement, which established the LoC.', 'In 1999, the Pakistani military crossed the LoC, sparking the Kargil War. Indian troops pushed the Pakistani soldiers back after bloody battles in the snowy heights of the Ladakh region.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

Amazon has disputed the allegation, saying it is not planning to display any added trade charges.', 'At a news conference marking President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt lashed out at Amazon over news reports that suggested the company was considering displaying theadded cost of tariff dutieson its online platform.', '“Why didn’t Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?” Leavitt asked.', 'She further attacked the company by saying that “Reuters recently wrote [that] Amazon partnered with a Chinese propaganda arm,” holding up what appeared to be a news article printout.', 'Though Amazon denied the White House’s allegation, its stock pricesank brieflyfollowing Leavitt’s comments before recovering again shortly afterwards.', 'The White House’s tirade against the retail giant is an indication of the pressure it is facing over Trump’s new tariffs –145 percentin the case of China and 10 percent on all other countries – which analysts say will lead to higher prices.', 'And while Amazon says it won’t proactively expose the tariffs as the reason prices are rising, other major online retailers aren’t as skittish.', 'On Tuesday,Punchbowl Newsreported that Amazon will soon “display how much of an item’s cost is derived from tariffs – right next to the product’s total listed price,” to illustrate how Trump’s tariffs are affecting thecost of goods.', 'The Trump administration’s fierce reaction to the Punchbowl article appeared to be based on a misinterpretation of internal plans being considered by Amazon, rather than any final decision.', 'Less than an hour after Leavitt’s news briefing, Amazon issued a statement saying that, though one of its teams had discussed “the idea of listing import charges on certain products,” it was “never a consideration for the main Amazon site”.', 'Only Amazon’s Haul service – its recently launched, low-cost storefront – “considered the idea” of listing import charges on certain products, a company spokesperson told The Associated Press news agency. But he said this “is not going to happen”.', 'The AP also reported that Trump called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to complain about the reported plans on Tuesday morning.

He was terrific,” Trump told reporters before leaving the White House for Michigan on Tuesday afternoon. “He solved a problem very quickly and he did the right thing. He’s a good guy.”', 'Trump’s tariffs – and the retaliatory responses from targeted countries,notably China– threaten to increase prices for online retailers and, by extension, American consumers.

The retail giant has, in recent years, adjusted its focus from selling big-ticket items like TVs and gaming consoles to everyday goods like laundry detergent and toilet paper.', 'Revenues, in turn, have gone up. In 2023, Amazon processed 5.9 billion delivery orders in the US, a whopping 15.7 percentage point increase in a single year. Its share of the US parcel market also rose by 16.3 percentage points from 2022 levels.', 'In the US, Amazon makes roughly 40 percent of e-commerce sales. Its business model relies heavily on third-party merchants, many of whom are based in China – they can offer bargain prices due to low manufacturing and regulatory costs.', 'A staggering 71 percent of the goods sold by Amazon in the US are manufactured in China, according to a 2024 survey by Jungle Scout. For context, that’s 2.5 times more than the number of products sourced from the US.', 'Third-party sellers are now faced with a choice of either raising prices or absorbing the extra costs of Trump’s tariffs. It’s an existential threat for many merchants, who subsist on razor-thin margins. E-commerce is going to take a hit.', 'Numerous online retailers have decried Trump’s trade moves. Several big-name companies including Amazon’s rivals Temu and Shein have already raised prices while specifically pointing to the costs of tariffs.', 'Earlier this month, Temu and Shein said in separate but nearly identical notes that their operating expenses had gone up “due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs”. They both announced that price hikes would take effect on April 25.', 'Temu, owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, now lists added “import charges”, which have reportedly doubled many items’ prices, although those available in local warehouses currently appear to be exempt.', 'Meanwhile, Shein, which is focused on fast fashion and based in Singapore, has a checkout banner that now reads, “Tariffs are included in the price you pay. You’ll never have to pay extra at delivery.”', 'Though Temu and Shein have experienced rapid growth in recent years – they were the top two most downloaded apps in the US in 2023 – their share of America’s e-commerce market remains much smaller than Amazon’s.', 'Still, their exposure to tariffs on Chinese imports remains just as significant.', 'According to a 2023 investigation by the US House Select Committee, nearly half of Temu and Shein’s goods shipments to the United States originated from China – amounting to approximately 600,000 packages per day.\\u200b', 'Like other e-commerce firms, Temu and Shein are attempting to move some production lines to the US, as well as stocking more inventory there.

He urged his wife and kids to pass through the checkpoint without him.', '“I knew my rights at the border in that regard. And I was also familiar with the extent of border searches,” he said. “This is the first time I’ve ever been stopped.”', 'But what happened next would put the lawyer in a precarious position.', 'Border control agents have considerable legal rights to search a person’s belongings. The idea is to prevent security hazards, contraband or environmental threats from entering the country.', 'Those searches, however, extend to the contents of electronic devices. And that raises questions about what material needs to be regulated — and what needs to be protected from the prying eyes of the government.', 'Makled knew the border agents could take his phone. But as a lawyer, he faced a thorny ethical dilemma. His phone contained privileged attorney-client information.', 'In the US, a basic tenet of the legal system is that a client can have frank discussions with their lawyer, with the safety of knowing anything they say will be kept confidential.', 'A substantial amount of Makled’s work was on his phone. When asked to hand it over, he told the border officers he couldn’t give them the device.', '“All my emails, my text messages, my files, the cloud-based software I use for my office,” he said, “it’s all through my phone.”', 'As a civil rights and criminal defence lawyer, Makled represents people he said are particularly vulnerable.', 'One of his clients is a protester who was arrested at a pro-Palestine encampment at the University of Michigan last year. She was later charged with resisting and obstructing police, a felony that carries up to a two-year prison sentence.', 'Makled believes he was targeted because the border officers knew this information. One of the agents, he said, even called him a “famous lawyer”, a comment he took to be a reference to the protester’s case.', 'In the end, he gave the agents written permission to see his contacts but no other permissions. After about 90 minutes at the airport, he was allowed to leave with his phone.', 'For nearly a century, Title 19 of the US code has allowed border control officers the right to search any person entering the country, their luggage or other items in their possession at the time of the inspection.', 'But digital devices today contain far more information than is relevant to a person’s trip.', 'The most recent fiscal year saw47,047electronic devices searched by border control officers, the vast majority of which belonged to non-US citizens.', 'That’s a nearly 13 percent increase over the previous fiscal year in 2023, when US Customs and Border Protection clocked41,767electronic searches.', 'The question of whether these searches can be manipulated for political gain or reprisals has long dogged the process.', 'In November 2018, for instance, an employee of the tech company Apple, Andreas Gal, said he was detained while returning to San Francisco from an international trip.', 'Like Makled, Gal was flagged for the TTRT. And like the lawyer, customs officers pushed to search his electronic devices. He refused. Gal later said he believed he was targeted in response to the political views he expressed online.', 'But in recent weeks, experts fear the threat of such searches has risen.', 'Since taking office for a second term in January, President Donald Trump has sought to deport noncitizens he sees as critical of the US or its ally Israel. Material from electronic devices has been among the evidence allegedly used to expel people from the country.', 'For example, kidney transplant specialistRasha Alawiehhad been denied re-entry after flying back to the US from her native Lebanon. She held a valid H-1B visa that allowed her to work in the US.', 'News reports indicate that the Trump administration cited photos recovered from her phone as motivation for expelling her, including images she had of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.', '“Glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be denied,” the Department of Homeland Security wrote in astatementafter Alawieh’s expulsion.', 'Also in March, the French government said one of its citizens, a scientist, was prevented from entering the US on account of the political messages on his phone.', 'The Trump administration has denied that accusation, however.', '“The French researcher in question was in possession of confidential information on his electronic device from Los Alamos National Laboratory — in violation of a non-disclosure agreement,” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin wrote on social media.', '“Any claim that his removal was based on political beliefs is blatantly false.”', 'There are two types of screenings a device may undergo while in border control custody.', 'A “light” search happens when an officer looks through an electronic device by hand. An advanced search, which legally requires “reasonable suspicion” of a crime, involves the device being connected to external equipment. The device may not be returned to its owner for weeks or months.', 'Border agents do not need a warrant to search an electronic device, although US citizens are not obligated to unlock their electronics in order to re-enter their country.', 'However, for travellers who are not US citizens or permanent residents, refusing to share these details could result in being denied entry.', 'But experts say these practices raise serious concerns about the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution, which grants protection from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government.', 'Esha Bhandari, the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, explained she has seen examples of the government using these border checks to bypass Fourth Amendment protections.', '“The government is increasingly treating this as a constitutional loophole,” Bhandari said.', '“They have someone under investigation, and rather than waiting on whether they can establish probable cause, which requires a judge to give a warrant, they wait until someone crosses the international border and treat that as a convenient opportunity to search their devices.”', 'But just how far that loophole can stretch is a matter of debate.', 'Saira Hussain, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the courts in the US have yet to reach a consensus about just how far searches of digital devices can go — and what the limits are.', '“At this moment, whether you fly into San Francisco vs Boston vs Atlanta, there are three different rulings on exactly which part of your phone can be searched, for what purposes [or] what level of suspicion is needed,” Hussain said. “A number of lower courts have ruled on the issue, [but] there has not been uniformity.”', 'For his part, Makled said he has not been deterred from travelling — or representing controversial causes.', '“I feel that this is an intimidation tactic. It’s an attempt to dissuade me from taking on these types of cases,” he said, referring to his defence of the protester arrested at the University of Michigan.', '“I say I won’t be dissuaded.

The New York Times reported that most of the 238 men deported to El Salvador have neither criminal records in the US nor documented links to a Venezuelan prison gang.', 'When Abrego Garcia was arrested in March 2019, a police informant told police he was an MS-13 member, according to a report known as a “gang field interview sheet”. A judge initially ruled in 2019 that government evidence about Abrego Garcia’s gang membership was “trustworthy” and was upheld on appeal; later, two federal judges ruled that the government’s information was unsupported.

He also issued decrees to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement on climate and theWorld Health Organization, amongst other international forums.', 'Trump continued to double down on a series of unconventional foreign policy proposals: taking over thePanama Canal, annexingGreenland, making Canada the 51st US state and “owning” Gaza.', 'And despite promising to be a “peace” president, Trump has said he intends to take the US annual Pentagon budget to a record $1 trillion.', 'He has distanced himself from neo-conservative foreign policy and does not position himself as a promoter of human rights or democracy abroad. His “America First” stance and scepticism of NATO align with realist principles, but his impulsiveness and highly personalised diplomacy diverge from traditional realism.', 'At the same time, he has not called for a full military or diplomatic retreat fromglobal affairs, setting him apart from isolationists.', 'So what exactly drives Trump’s foreign policy?', 'Experts say it is primarily fuelled by a dissatisfaction with the current global system, which he sees as unfairly disadvantaging the US with its rules and restrictions. Instead, Trump appears to want Washington to leverage its enormous military and economic power to set the rules to assert global dominance while reducingUS contributionsand commitments to others.', '“The Trump doctrine is ‘smash and grab’, take what you want from others and let your allies do the same,” said Josh Ruebner, a lecturer at Georgetown University’s Program on Justice and Peace.', 'Mathew Burrows, programme lead of the Strategic Foresight Hub at the Stimson Center think tank, said Trump wants US primacy without paying the costs that come with that.', '“He’s withdrawing the US from the rest of the world, particularly economically,” Burrows, a veteran of the US Department of State and CIA, told Al Jazeera.', '“But at the same time, he somehow believes that the US … will be able to tell other countries to stop fighting, to do whatever the US wants,” he said. “Hegemony just doesn’t work that way.”', 'Trump appears to believe that threatening and imposing tariffs – andoccasionally violence– is a way of employing US leverage to get world leaders to acquiesce to his demands.', 'But critics say the US president discounts the power of nationalism in other countries, which prompts them to eventually fight back. Such was the case for Canada.', 'After Trump imposed tariffs and called for Canada to become the 51st state, this led to a wave of nationalist pride in the northern neighbour and an abrupt shift from theConservative Party to the Liberal Party.', 'From Canadato China, foreign governments have accused Trump of “bullying” and blackmail.', 'Some of Trump’s Democratic rivals have rushed to accuse him of abandoning the US global role, but at the same time, the US president has been projecting American strength to pressure other countries.', 'While not entirely isolationist, his approach marks a significant turn from that of his predecessor.', 'The late Secretary of StateMadeleine Albrightfamously said in 1998: “We are the indispensable nation. We stand tall and we see further than other countries into the future.”', 'That purported power and wisdom, as Albright envisioned, put the US in a position to implementPax Americana– the concept of a peaceful global order led by Washington.', 'Trump does see the US as proverbially taller than other nations, but perhaps not in the way Albright meant.', '“America does not need other countries as much as other countries need us,” White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier this month.', 'Her statement, however, was to stress that other nations must negotiate with the US to avoidTrump’s tariffs.', 'In this context, Trump is seeking revenues and jobs – not an international system governed by liberal values in the way that Washington defines them.', 'However, Burrows said the chief aim of Trump’s foreign policy is to dismantle the existing global order.', '“A big part of his world view is really his negative feelings towards the current order, where others appear to be rising,” Burrows said. “And so, a lot of this is just tearing down.”', 'Much of the system that manages relations between different countries was put in place after World War II, with the US leading the way.', 'The United Nations and its agencies, the articles of international law, various treaties on the environment, nuclear proliferation and trade, and formal alliances have governed global affairs for decades.', 'Critics of Washington point out that the US violated and opted out of the system where it saw fit.', 'For example, the US never joined the Rome Statute that established theInternational Criminal Courtin 1998. It invaded Iraq in 2003 without United Nations Security Council authorisation in an apparent breach of the UN Charter. And it has been providing unconditional support to Israel despite the US ally’s well-documented abuses against Palestinians.', '“The United States has done a lot to stand up sort of multilateral institutions – the UN and others – that are based around these ideas,” said Matthew Duss, the executive vice president at the Center for International Policy.', '“But the United States has always found ways to violate these norms and laws when it when it serves our purposes,” he added, pointing to former US President Joe Biden’s support for Israel’s war on Gaza and President George W Bush’s policies after the 9/11 attacks, which included extraordinary rendition,torture, invasion and prolonged occupation.', 'But for Trump and his administration, there are indications that the global order is not just to be worked around; it needs to go.', '“The post-war global order is not just obsolete, it is now a weapon being used against us,” Trump’s Secretary of StateMarco Rubiotold senators during his confirmation hearing in January.', 'Trump recently told Time Magazine that the US has been “ripped off” by “almost every country in the world”.', 'His rhetoric on foreign policy appears to echo his statements about promising to look after “America’s forgotten men and women” who have been mistreated by the “elites” domestically.', 'While the modern world order has empowered US companies and left the country with immense wealth and military and diplomatic might, Americans do have major issues to complain about.', 'Globalisation saw the outsourcing of US jobs to countries with less expensive labour. Past interventionist policies – particularly thewars in Iraqand Afghanistan – are largely seen as strategic blunders that produced a generation of veterans with physical and mental injuries.', 'Geoffrey Kabaservice, vice president of political studies at the Niskanen Center, a centre-right think tank in Washington, DC, noted that wages have stagnated for many Americans for decades.', '“The fact is that the benefits of globalisation were very maldistributed, and some people up at the top made enormous plutocratic sums of money, and very little of that flowed down to the mass of the working class,” Kabaservice told Al Jazeera.', 'For people who saw their factories closed and felt like they were living in “left-behind areas”, electing Trump was “retribution” against the system, Kabaservice said, adding that Trump’s “America First” approach has pitted the US against the rest of the world.', '“America is turning its back on the world,” Kabaservice said. “Trump believes that America can be self-sufficient in all things, but already the falsity of this doctrine is proving true.”', 'Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute, a think tank that promotes diplomacy, said Trump’s foreign policy, including his approach to allies, comes from “the politics of grievance”.', '“He does believe that the United States – because of its role as world policeman, which he’s not necessarily in love with – has been shouldering a lot of the security burden of the world without getting proper compensation,” Parsi told Al Jazeera.', 'The US president has been calling on NATO allies to increase their defence spending, while suggesting that Washington should be paid more for stationing troops in allied countries like Germany andSouth Korea.', 'So how does Trump view the world?', '“He’s an aggressive unilateralist, and in many ways, he’s just an old-school imperialist,” Duss said of Trump. “He wants to expandAmerican territory. He wants to extract wealth from other parts of the world … This is a kind of foreign policy approach from an earlier era.”', 'He noted that Trump’s foreign policy is to act aggressively and unilaterally to achieve what he sees as US interests.', 'Kabaservice said Trump wants the US to return to an age when it was a manufacturing powerhouse and not too involved in the affairs of the world.', '“He likes the idea that maybe the United States is a great power, sort of in a 19th-century model, and it lets the other great powers have their own sphere of influence,” he said.', 'Kabaservice added that Trump wants the US to have “its own sphere of influence” and to be “expanding in the way that optimistic forward-moving powers are”.', 'This notion of an America with its own “sphere of influence” appeared to be supported by Rubio when he spoke earlier this year\\xa0of the inevitability of“multipolar world, multi-great powers in different parts of the planet”.', 'Parsi said that Trump is seeking hemispheric hegemony above all, despite his aversion for regime change – hence his emphasis on acquiring Greenland and the Panama Canal.', '“You’re shifting not from the politics of domination towards restraint; you’re shifting from the politics of global domination to a more limited form of domination,” Parsi told Al Jazeera.', '“Focus only on your own hemisphere.”', 'The US may have already experienced what happens when these views of nostalgia and grievance see real-world implications. Trump’s erratic trade policy rocked the US stock market and sparked threats of counter-levies from Canada to the European Union to China.', 'Eventually, Trump postponed many of his tariffs, keeping a baseline of 10 percent levies and additional importing fees onChinese goods. Asked why he suspended the measures, the US president acknowledged that it was due to how the tariffs were received. “People were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippy,” he said.', 'Ultimately, Trump’s unilateralism and unpredictability have “broken the world’s trust in significant ways” that will outlast his presidency, Kabaservice told Al Jazeera.', '“In the broad span of history, Trump will be seen as the person who committed terrible unforced errors that led to the end of the American century and the beginning of theChinese century,” he said.', 'During his inauguration speech earlier this year, the US president said his legacy “will be that of a peacemaker and unifier”.', '“His actual legacy will be that he has torn down the global system that the US created,” said Burrows, of the Stimson Center.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

Madrid was forced to declare a state of emergency.', 'Although power has been largely restored, transport remains in dire straits, with trains and flights reporting delays. No firm cause for the shutdown has yet emerged.', 'With the power back on, attention is turning to what caused such a widespread failure of the region’s networks.', 'Portugal’s electricity provider, Redes Energeticas Nacionais (REN), said a “rare atmospheric phenomenon” had caused a severe imbalance in temperatures that led to the widespread shutdowns.', 'REN said: “Due to extreme temperature variations in the interior of Spain, there were anomalous oscillations in the very high voltage lines (400 kV), a phenomenon known as ‘induced atmospheric vibration’.”', 'The Portuguese prime minister, Luis Montenegro, also said the issue originated in Spain.', 'However, in a statement on Tuesday, Spain’s national meteorological office,\\xa0Aemet, appeared to rule out the weather as a culprit.', '“During the day of 28 April, no unusual meteorological or atmospheric phenomena were detected, and nor were there sudden variations in the temperature in our network of meteorological stations,” Aemet said.', 'The Spanish government said the cause of the power cut is still unknown and warned against speculation.', '“My gut feeling is that multiple factors were behind the blackout,” Kang Li, smart energy systems chairman at the University of Leeds, told Al Jazeera.', '“It usually takes several months for forensic grid data to be properly analysed,” he added, “though an interim report could be done in several weeks.”', 'Bloomberg News reported that Spain has seen a record number of hours with negative power prices in recent months as more wind and solar energy supplies the grid.

In doing so, Trump “is seeking a lack of accountability to do things that the law otherwise prohibits”, said Matthew Lindsay, a University of Baltimore law professor.', 'The Trump administration’s use of national security or foreign policy as a shield against judicial overview is a stark difference from other administrations, Lindsay said.', 'We talked to lawyers, historians and criminologists to examine thefalse narrativesand spin propelling Trump’s immigration policies in the first 100 days.', 'In 2018, during his first term, Trump described a caravan of thousands of immigrants walking towards the US southern border as an invasion. Many of them were expected to request asylum in the US. Constitutional law experts say that what legally counts as an invasion is an armed attack by militaries or paramilitaries.', 'Many Gang Members and some very bad people are mixed into the Caravan heading to our Southern Border. Please go back, you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!', '— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)October 29, 2018', 'During the 2024 presidential campaign, as immigration reached historic highs during Joe Biden’s presidency, Trump began tying the invasion narrative to one of his signature policy promises: Mass deportations.', '“I will stop the migrant invasion, and we will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country,” he said at an October\\xa0rally.', 'Ten days later, at another\\xa0rally, he said: “We will not be occupied. We will not be conquered. That’s what they’re doing. This is an invasion into our country of a foreign military.”', 'So Trump upon taking office issued an\\xa0executive order\\xa0declaring a national emergency at thesouthern border. In two other directives, he described immigration as an invasion.', 'One of the laws he eventually invoked – the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 – lets the president detain and deport people from a “hostile nation or government” without a hearing when the US is either at war with that country or the country has “perpetrated, attempted, or threatened” an invasion against the US.', '“This is a time of war because Biden allowed millions of people, many of them criminals, many of them at the highest level,” Trump told reporters on March 16. “That’s an invasion. They invaded our country.”', 'TheAlien Enemies Acthas been used only three times in US history, each during wartime.', 'In February, the State Department designated Tren de Aragua – a gang that formed between 2013 and 2015 in a Venezuelan prison – as a foreign “terrorist” organisation.', 'In March, Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport hundreds of Venezuelans whom he said were Tren de Aragua gang members who had “infiltrated” cities across the country. They were sent to the Terrorism Confinement Center, orCECOT, a maximum-security prison in El Salvador.', 'They were deported without due process; the government didn’t present evidence of their gang membership before a judge and the migrants weren’t given the opportunity to defend themselves. CECOT is the largest prison in Latin America and has been decried for human rights abuses, such as torture and lack of medical care.', 'Trump has repeatedly said that countries – namely the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Venezuela – send people from prisons and mental hospitals to the US. He has not cited evidence.', '“We were elected to clean up the mess of this country, and we had millions and millions of people come in who were criminals, who were murderers, who were everything you can imagine,” Trump said on April 21. “Drug lords, drug dealers, they came in from prisons and from mental institutions. And I was elected to move them out.”', 'The immigrant crime narrative drove his successful presidential campaign. Vice President JD Vance pointed to Haitian immigration in Springfield, Ohio, cherry-picking from limited statistics to say immigrants raised the number of murders. In addition to targeting Springfield, Trump said Tren de Aragua took over Aurora, Colorado.', 'To support its deportation efforts, the White House saidKilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant who the US government said it mistakenly deported to CECOT, is an MS-13 gang member. The administration has exaggerated findings from earlier judges on his case and highlighted\\xa0tattoos that don’t correspond with MS-13.', 'Criminologists who study potential links between migration and crime say despite some high-profile crimes committed by immigrants, they commit crimes at lower rates than native-born US citizens.', 'The Marshall Project found no link between crime and migrant arrivals from April 2022 to May 2023 in New York, Chicago, Washington, DC and Denver, after Texas Governor Greg Abbott began busing immigrants into those cities. The Marshall Project’s 2024 report looked at policing data in cases involving crimes such as robbery, murders and shootings.', 'A 2018 national study by University of Wisconsin and Purdue University sociologists found that increases in the immigrant population in the US are associated with significant decreases in violence. The study analysed violent crime from 1990 to 2014, examining the association between changes in undocumented migration and violent crime at the state level in all 50 states and Washington, DC.', 'A National Institute of Justice study of Texas Department of Public Safety data from 2012 to 2018 showed undocumented immigrants are arrested at less than half the rate of native-born US citizens for violent and drug crimes. Researchers separated arrest data for crimes committed by undocumented immigrants from data for crimes committed by documented immigrants and native-born US citizens.', 'Trump said in an April 25 Time magazine\\xa0interview, “We have crime rates under Biden that went through the roof, and we have to bring those rates down. And unfortunately, those rates have been added to by the illegal immigrants that he allowed into the country.”', 'Contrary to Trump’s\\xa0statement, FBI data shows that\\xa0violent crime\\xa0dropped during Biden’s presidency.', '“People are like, ‘Crime is out of control.’ Well, actually, crime is not out of control right now, but the perception is that it’s out of control,” said Charis Kubrin, a criminology, law and society professor at the University of California, Irvine.', '“It’s very easy to turn and blame immigrants, because those stereotypes have long existed and because it’s sort of this natural ‘in group, out group’ approach that people take.”', 'Kubrin said Trump’s misleading claims about immigrants and crime have led to policies based on faulty assumptions that don’t exclusively target people with criminal convictions.', 'The New York Times\\xa0reported most of the238 men deportedto El Salvador have neither criminal records in the US nor documented links to Tren de Aragua.', 'Kubrin said misleading perceptions of immigrant crime can harm immigrants.', '“Other consequences include increased hate and hate crimes against immigrants and against racial and ethnic minorities who may resemble immigrants, like Asians and Hispanics, but are not immigrants themselves,” Kubrin said.', 'Like previous administrations, many of Trump’s immigration policies have been challenged by lawsuits and halted with temporary restraining orders.', 'Trump and his officials have dismissed the constitutional division of powers among the legislative, executive and judicial government branches. At times, they’ve said the courts have no role to play and that judges who don’t agree with Trump should be impeached.', 'After a federal judge ruled the Trump administrationcould not deportVenezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act, White House adviser Stephen Miller\\xa0said, “A district court judge has no authority to direct the national security operations of the executive branch.”', 'Trump’s “border tsar” Tom Homan\\xa0said, “I don’t care what the judges think.”', 'White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described the judge’s order as having “no lawful basis”, saying “federal courts generally have no jurisdiction over the President’s conduct of foreign affairs.”', 'Legal experts say federal courts have the power to review and rule on the constitutionality of the president’s immigration actions.', '“There is absolutely nothing about an immigration policy that, by virtue of the fact that it is an immigration policy, insulates it from judicial review,” Michael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina professor of jurisprudence, said.', 'The executive branch has broad discretion over foreign policy matters, but that doesn’t mean that cases that deal with foreign policy, including immigration cases, are off-limits for the courts, Mary Ellen O’Connell, University of Notre Dame law professor, agreed.', 'Rick Su, a University of North Carolina immigration law professor, said, “The Trump administration appears to be arguing that just because foreign affairs is involved, the administration does not have to follow the law at all, that whatever they do is the law, and that the courts cannot exercise any jurisdiction over what they do.”', 'But courts haven’t ruled “that the law or judicial review does not apply to an immigration decision … just because foreign affairs is involved”, Su said.', 'The Trump administration has said Biden abused his executive powers when he created certain programmes that let people temporarily enter or stay in the US legally. Vance also framed it this way during the campaign, falsely saying the beneficiaries of the programmes were “illegal immigrants” because the programmes were illegal, in his view.', 'Leavitt said people who entered the US via humanitarian parole programmes and eventually received Temporary Protected Status “came here for economic reasons, and they illegally entered our country”.', 'Humanitarian parole and Temporary Protected Status give people temporary legal authority to live and work in the US, immigration lawyers said. When those protections expire or are terminated, people’s immigration status reverts to what they had before these protections. Neither parole nor Temporary Protected Status directly leads to US citizenship.', 'The Trump administration has tried to end these protections before their expiration.', 'Kristi Noem, Trump’s homeland security secretary, tried ending Temporary Protected Status for certain Venezuelans. Courts have temporarily halted the termination. The department is not extending the programme forAfghans and Camerooniansand cut it short for Haitians. TPS for Haitians is now set to expire on August 3, six months before the original deadline.', 'The department also tried ending the protection of people with humanitarian parole under the programme for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans. But a federal judge temporarily halted the move on April 14.', 'Judge Indira Talwani said the humanitarian parole programme beneficiaries complied with the available immigration processes.', '“As lawful parolees, they did not have to fear arrest for being in the United States, were permitted to legally work if they received work authorisation, and could apply for adjustment of status or other benefits while paroled into this country,” Talwani wrote. “The immediate impact of the shortening of their grant of parole is to cause their lawful status in the United States to lapse early – in less than two weeks.”', 'Maria Cristina Garcia, a Cornell University history professor and migration expert, said some immigration changes are happening “quietly at the bureaucratic level”, such as the denial of visas, while others were “announced with great fanfare”, such as the suspension of refugee admissions.', '“I don’t think we have a full understanding yet of the many ways the Trump administration is changing our immigration system,” Garcia said.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

Chinese officials have insisted that any such talks have yet to begin.', 'Ray Wang, a Washington, DC-based analyst who focuses on US-China economic statecraft, said Trump’s strategy of maximising pressure on China could backfire and push Beijing towards further “decoupling” from the US economy.', '“Facing embargo-level tariffs and intensifying hawkish rhetoric, Beijing is unlikely to engage in meaningful negotiations, thereby complicating efforts to address the very economic concerns the policy aims to resolve,” Wang told Al Jazeera.', 'Marina Zhang, an associate professor at the Australia-China Relations Institute, University of Technology Sydney, said Chinese manufacturers may increasingly look to other countries to insulate themselves from the US economy.', '“For China, this presents both risks and opportunities: while its exporters to the US face immediate pressure, Beijing’s broader push for market diversification – to ASEAN, Africa, and Latin America – gains new urgency and traction,” Zhang told Al Jazeera.', 'As the US-China trade war lumbers on, Trump has also set his sights on US trade with other countries generally.', 'Over the past 100 days, Trump has hit Mexico and Canada with separate rounds of on-again, off-again tariffs.', 'On April 2, he expanded the trade war to more than 180 countries and territories with the announcement of so-called “reciprocal tariffs” of between 10 and 49 percent.', 'Trump subsequently paused the tariffs for 90 days in anticipation of country-by-country negotiations, but he has continued to push China’s trading partners to close loopholes for US-bound exports.', '“The difference [from his first term] is that Trump’s China strategy is part of a worldwide economic strategy. For example, as he cuts new trade deals with Japan, South Korea, Singapore, etc, he will want to make sure that they are not helping China sidestep fairness in US-China trade,” said Wilder, the former White House official.', 'Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said Trump’s end goal is to rewrite the longstanding “Washington consensus” supporting free trade and market liberalisation to one shaped in his image.', '“The Trump administration is changing the nature of its economic and security partnerships and essentially its relationship with the entire world. That’s not directed specifically at China,” Thompson told Al Jazeera.', '“This is really about Trump’s perception that the US has been taken advantage of and hasn’t benefitted from globalisation, and, frankly, reflecting the American voters’ perception of the same thing.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

In less than a week, the song has garnered more than 140,000 views on YouTube.', 'And it is not the only song. The killings in the picturesque resort town of Pahalgam marked the worst attack against tourists in Kashmir in a quarter of a century. But even as New Delhi hits back against Pakistan, which it accuses of links to the attack – a charge Islamabad denies – a wave of incendiary music tracks, crafted and circulated within hours, has set off an anti-Muslim backlash in India.', 'Set to pulsing beats and catchy rhymes, these songs, part of a genre that has come to be known as Hindutva Pop, are calling for violent retribution for the attack. From songs that label Indian Muslims as “traitors” to songs that advocate their boycott, the country’s smartphones are buzzing. Hindutva is the Hindu majoritarian political ideology of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies.', 'Al Jazeera found at least 20 songs that carried and amplified such Islamophobic themes at a time when Indians were anxiously scrolling through their digital feeds for more information on the aftermath of the attack.', 'These songs have a chillingly consistent narrative: Since the attackers are believed to have singled out Hindu tourists, Indian Muslims can no longer be trusted – never mind that a Muslim Kashmiri pony rider who tried to stop the gunmen was also killed.', 'Apart from these, a glut of other hyper-nationalist songs has also emerged in the past week, pushing warmongering rhetoric deeper into Indian digital veins. There are songs that call for Pakistan to be nuked or for the Indian government to “wipe Pakistan off the map”, and others that advocate for “Pakistani blood” in exchange for the deaths,', 'These songs have become a part of a broader digital push by Hindutva groups, who are using social media and encrypted platforms like WhatsApp to stoke fear, hatred, and division among Indians – all at a time when tensions with neighbouring Pakistan are ratcheting up.', 'This campaign is mirroring real-world violence, across multiple Indian states. In Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand, Muslims have faced brutal attacks and threats. Kashmiri Muslims have been evicted from their homes, street vendors assaulted, and in chilling acts of retribution, Muslim patients have been denied medical care by Hindu doctors.', 'On Friday, a Muslim man was shot dead, with a Hindu supremacist in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, claiming responsibility for the shooting and saying it was retribution for the Pahalgam attack.', 'All the 20 songs that Al Jazeera analysed saw a common theme being pushed: a reiteration of the assertion that tourists were killed for their Hindu identities, and therefore, Hindus across the country must now feel threatened in living around Muslims. Multiple witness and survivor accounts of the Pahalgam attack suggest that the gunmen asked the tourists to recite the Kalimas (sacred Islamic verses) and the men who could not do so were shot.', 'The song Pehle Dharm Poocha (They Asked About Religion First) was released on April 23, the day after the attack. Singer Kavi Singh insists that letting Muslims stay on in India after the country’s partition in 1947 was “a mistake”, and asks them to go to Pakistan.', 'Another song, Ab Ek Nahi Huye Toh Kat Jaaoge (If You Don’t Unite Now You Will be Slaughtered), by singer Chandan Deewana, is addressed entirely to Hindus, asking them to rise up and “save our religion”. The song insists that Hindus, not Indians, are under threat and warns that they will be “slaughtered” if they do not unite. It has garnered more than 60,000 views on YouTube in just two days.', 'Jaago Hindu Jaago (Wake Up, Hindus) is a song that asks Hindus to identify “traitors within the country”, a coded reference to Muslims. The song’s video on YouTube contains an AI-re-enactment of the Pahalgam attack and has more than 128,000 views so far.', 'Another song, Modi Ji Ab Maha Yudh Ho Jaane Do (Modi ji, Let The Great War Begin), refers to Muslims as “snakes” living in India. Anothersongcalls the events in the country a “religious war”, and yet another asks for Hindus in India to be allowed to carry arms.', 'These songs provide a background score for social media posts that bear similar themes.', 'From AI-generated videos and memes recreating the attack to Ghibli images, social media timelines have seen a flood of content emerging from the attack. Much of it carries similar undertones: to paint the attack as an assault on Hindus and the Hindu religion, while exhorting Hindus to “unite” against the threat of Muslims.', 'Some posts liken the Pahalgam killings to the October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups, and exhort the Indian government to “take revenge the Israel way”.\\xa0Israel launched a war on the Gaza Strip that has, since October 2023, killed more than 52,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 117,000 others.', 'Raqib Hameed Naik, the executive director of the Washington, DC-based Center for the Study of Organized Hate (CSOH), which tracks hate speech in India, said the centre has observed “a sharp spike” in anti-Muslim rhetoric on social media since the Kashmir attack.', '“The [Muslim] community is frequently portrayed as an existential threat through memes, AI-generated images, videos and misinformation, systematically designed to inflame passions and justify exclusionary rhetoric,” Naik said.', 'In addition to the 20 songs that Al Jazeera identified, there is a plethora of songs on YouTube abusing Pakistan (one song’s title is “Pakistan, You M***********”, and it has garnered more than 75,000 views). The videos accompanying some of these songs feature military simulation videos of air strikes, soldiers in combat and tanks firing munitions.', 'Some of them even feature the singers dressed in military fatigues and camouflage face paint, with one singer holding a rifle throughout the video.', 'Since the Kashmir attack, there have been multiple incidents of violence on the streets, targeting Kashmiri and other Muslims across the country.', 'The Association For Protection Of Civil Rights (APCR), a civil rights advocacy group consisting of lawyers and human rights activists, has recorded 21 incidents of anti-Muslim violence, intimidation and hate speech across the country in the days after April 22.', 'These include assaulting Kashmiri women and students, delivering hate speeches against Muslims in public rallies and asking the Indian government to replicate Israel’s actions in Palestine against Kashmiris – as well as evicting Kashmiri students from their rented homes and hostels.', '“Indians are being bombarded by this hateful campaign, which uses the attack as a base,” said Nadeem Khan, the general secretary of APCR. “This campaign has taken the country’s temperature to its boiling point.”', 'APCR, he said, was now in the process of arranging legal aid for victims of the post-attack violence.', 'Members of Modi’s BJP have been linked to some of the hate speech and violence.', 'One BJP minister in the western state of Maharashtra, Nitesh Rane, called for an economic boycott of Muslims, while addressing a public event attended by hundreds last week. “If they are behaving this way about religion, then why should we buy things from them and make them rich? You people will have to take a pledge that whenever you make any purchase, you should buy it only from a Hindu,” Rane told\\xa0the gathering.', 'Another BJP legislator entered Jaipur city’s Jama Masjid and pasted offensive posters inside the premises of a mosque, during a protest against Pakistan for its involvement in the Kashmir attack. A group of BJP leaders in Mumbai were booked by the police for abusing and assaulting Muslim hawkers in central Mumbai.', 'In addition, leaders of the BJP as well as its ideological affiliates, the Bajrang Dal and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, have also been organising protests against Pakistan, often indulging in anti-Muslim hate speeches in the process.', 'The Washington DC-based CSOH has recorded at least 10 hate speech events since April 22, where participants have threatened Muslims with violence, advocated for a boycott of Muslims, asked Hindus to arm themselves and evenwarnedKashmiri Muslims to leave, failing which they would “face consequences”.', 'Naik, from CSOH, said that the online hate campaign against Muslims had sought to “justify” this violence.', '“This follows a longstanding pattern where certain domestic or international incidents are weaponised to demonise Muslims and promote hate and violence against them in India,” he said.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

US trade levies on most imports from China have climbed to 145 percent. Beijing retaliated with duties of its own, at 125 percent on US goods.', 'Trump has long accused China of exploiting the US on trade, casting his tariffs as necessary to revive domestic manufacturing and reshore jobs back to the US. He also wants to use tariffs to finance tax cuts. Most economists remain sceptical Trump will achieve his aims.', 'For now, the US and China are locked in a high-stakes game of chicken. The world is waiting to see which country will yield and which will stay the course. As Trump\\xa0nears his first 100 days\\xa0in office for the second time, here’s where the tariff war with China stands:', 'Trump recently played up the possibility of securing a trade deal with China. Last week, the US presidentsaidhis tariffs on China will “come down substantially” in the near future.', '“We’re going to have a fair deal with China,” Trump told reporters on April 23, stirring hopes of a de-escalation. He also said his administration was “actively” negotiating with the Chinese side without elaborating.', 'On April 24, however, China’s Ministry of Commerce rebuffed president Trump’s remarks, saying there wereno talks taking placebetween the\\xa0two countries.', '“Any claims about the progress of China-US economic and trade negotiations are groundless and have no factual basis,” ministry spokesman He Yadong said.', 'While he insisted that Beijing won’t duck any economic blows from Washington, he also said the door was “wide open” for talks.', 'Last week, the Reuters news agency reported that\\xa0China was evaluating exemptions for select US imports – a list of up to 131 products.', 'Beijing has not made any public statement on the issue.', 'Trump introduced his sweeping tariffs on China less than three weeks ago. The fallout for US businesses won’t be fully felt until later this year. Still, the warning signals are already flashing red.', 'Data from the US Department of Agriculture shows that exports of soya beans – the biggest US farm export – fell dramatically for the period April 11-17, the first full week of reporting since Trump’s China tariff announcement.', 'By April 17, net sales of US soya beans dropped by 50 percent compared with the previous week. That was driven by a 67 percent fall in weekly soya bean exports to China, which, until recently, was America’s biggest export destination for the legume.', 'According to Piergiuseppe Fortunato, an adjunct professor of economics at the University of Neuchatel in Switzerland, “China’s retaliatory tariffs will hit US farmers hard. Some may go out of business.” He added that all sectors with exposure to China would come under strain.', 'In 2023, the US exported roughly $15bn of oil, gas and coal to China. Losing that market\\xa0would hit\\xa0US energy firms.', 'Since the start of Trump’s tariff war, cargo shipments have plummeted. According to Linerlytica, a shipping data provider, Chinese freight bookings bound for the US fell by 30 to 60 percent in April.', 'The drastic reduction in shipping from America’s third largest trading partner – after Canada and Mexico – has not yet been felt. In May, however, thousands of companies will need to restock their inventories.', 'According to Bloomberg News, retail giants Walmart and Target told Trump in a meeting last week that shoppers are likely to see empty shelves and higher prices from next month. They also warned that supply shocks could roll out to Christmas.', 'Electronic appliances, such as TV sets and washing machines, made up 46.4 percent of US imports from China in 2022. The US also imports a lot of its clothing and pharmaceutical product ingredients from China. The price of these goods will begin to rise from next month.', 'On April 22, the International Monetary Fund raised its US inflation forecast to 3 percent in 2025, owing to tariffs – a full 1 percentage point higher than in January. The lender also lowered its US economic growth forecast and raised its expectation that the US will tip into recession this year.', 'Despite growing tensions between the US and China, Washington and Beijing remain major trading partners.', 'According to the Office of the US Trade Representative, the US imported$438.9bnin Chinese goods last year.', 'That amounts to roughly 3 percent of China’s total economic output, which remains heavily reliant on exports.', 'In a report shared with its clients this month, Goldman Sachs said it expects Trump’s tariffs to drag down China’s gross domestic product (GDP) by as much as 2.4 percentage points.', 'For their part, China’s top officials said the country can do without American farm and energy imports and promised to achieve a 5 percent GDP growth target for this year.', 'Zhao Chenxin, vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, said that together with non-US imports, domestic farm and energy production would be enough to satisfy demand.', '“Even if we do not purchase feed grains and oilseeds from the United States, it will not have much impact on our country’s grain supply,” Zhao said on Monday.', 'He also noted there would be limited impact on China’s energy supplies if companies stopped importing US fossil fuels.', 'In some ways, experts said, China has been preparing for this crisis.', 'Fortunato told Al Jazeera: “The US is one of China’s biggest export markets, so tariffs will slow GDP growth. But Beijing has played this smartly as it began diversifying its imports away from the US during the first Trump trade war” in 2018.', 'He also pointed out that “the US depends on China for up to 60 percent of itscritical mineralimports, used in everything from clean energy to military technology. The opposite flow simply isn’t there, so the US is more vulnerable.”', 'Trump has made little secret of his wish to conscript US allies into a trade war. The administration said it aims to strike free trade deals with the European Union, Great Britain and Japan.', 'More generally, reports suggest that Washington is\\xa0asking trade\\xa0partners to loosen their economic ties with China as a pre-condition for securing relief from Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs.', 'Nevertheless, US allies seem largely opposed to any economic showdown with China. Last week, the European Commission said it has no intention of “decoupling” from China.', 'Elsewhere, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves recently told the Daily Telegraph newspaper: “China is the second biggest economy in the world, and it would be, I think, very foolish to not engage.”', 'Many countries are not in a position to abandon their trade ties with Beijing. The EU, in particular, has a huge trade deficit with China. Cutting off access to Chinese goods – both consumer products and inputs for industry – would bruise its already sluggish economy.', 'Across the developing world, China’s trade role is equally as crucial. Roughly a quarter of Bangladesh’s and Cambodia’s imports come from China. Nigeria and Saudi Arabia are similarly dependent on Beijing for their goods imports.', '“It’s hard to see why countries would want to undermine their own business interests to try and reduce America’s trade deficit with China,” Fortunato said. “On this point, I think Trump has been short-sighted and may be forced to blink first on lowering tariffs with China.”', 'The Chinese Communist Party doesn’t need to worry about its next election cycle. Trump’s Republican Party does, so Beijing has the political upper hand in Trump’s trade war. Simply put, it has more time on its side.', 'For Trump’s party,\\xa0his sabre rattling already looks politically costly. A newEconomist-YouGovpoll shows Americans reporting Trump’s economic actions have hurt them personally more than they’ve helped by a 30-point margin.', 'And public approval of the president’s economic management has been low for a while: It had fallen to 37 percent in aReuters-Ipsos pollpublished on March 31, his lowest score ever in that survey.', 'If Trump stays the course, it is likely that his approval ratings might fall still lower, jeopardising the Republican Party’s fragile grip on the US House of Representatives – and possibly the Senate, experts said.', '“For these reasons”, Fortunato said, “China does not feel compelled to rush to the negotiating table to secure a trade deal. That will probably fall to Trump.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

It also announced the closure of its border with Pakistan, trade suspension, revocation of visas, and a reduction in Pakistani diplomats in India.', 'In response, Pakistan’s National Security Committee (NSC), its top civil-military decision-making body,announced similar measures, including border and airspace closures, suspension of trade, and, significantly, a threat to suspend its participation in all bilateral agreements with India, including the Simla Agreement.', 'Signed in 1972, the Simla Agreement forms the bedrock of India-Pakistan relations, governing the Line of Control (LoC) and outlining commitments to resolve disputes peacefully.', 'Pakistan’s threat to suspend the agreement marks a potentially serious escalation. But what exactly is the Simla Agreement, and what are the implications if Pakistan pulls out of it?', 'Seven months after the 1971 war, which India won and which led to the creation of Bangladesh, Pakistani President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi met in Shimla (sometimes also spelt as Simla), the hilly capital of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, to normalise relations.', 'Key points of the agreement[PDF], signed on July 2, 1972, included the peaceful settlement of disputes and resolving issues, including Kashmir, bilaterally.', 'It also urged respect for territorial sovereignty, integrity, political independence and noninterference in internal affairs.', 'One of the most important outcomes was the renaming of the Ceasefire Line, the working border between the two countries, to the Line of Control (LoC), with both sides agreeing not to change it unilaterally.', 'Following the 1971 war, the agreement also led to the release of more than 90,000 Pakistani prisoners of war India was holding.', '“Pending the final settlement of any of the problems between the two countries, neither side shall unilaterally alter the situation, and both shall prevent the organisation, assistance or encouragement of any acts detrimental to the maintenance of peaceful and harmonious relations,” the agreement stated.', 'Ahmer Bilal Soofi, a leading international law expert and former legal adviser to the Pakistan government, described the Simla Agreement as an interim but crucial framework between the two countries.', '“Suspending the agreement would require a meticulous internal assessment” by Pakistan to ensure that it serves the country’s interests in retaliating against India, Soofi told Al Jazeera. “Any decision must involve extreme due diligence.”', 'Another international law expert, Muhammad Mushtaq Ahmad of Shifa Tameer-e-Millat University, explained that India has long interpreted the Simla Agreement as superseding United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.', '“India’s position is that the agreement made the Kashmir issue a purely bilateral matter, removing any need for international mediation,” Ahmad said.', 'The Himalayan territory has been a flashpoint between the two countries since they gained independence from British rule in 1947, with each controlling parts of Kashmir but claiming it in full. Since independence, the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought four wars, three of them over Kashmir.', 'Pakistan, on the other hand, maintains that the Simla Agreement reaffirmed UNSC resolutions advocating a diplomatic and political solution.', 'After the Modi government revoked Indian-administered Kashmir’s semi-autonomous status in 2019, Pakistan accused New Delhi of violating the Simla Agreement.', 'Islamabad could cite that to justify the suspension of its participation in the agreement, Ahmad said.

But India’s recent war-mongering rhetoric and blame for attacks without evidence suggest otherwise,” Hosain said, referring to India’s allegation that Pakistan was responsible for the Pahalgam attack. Pakistan has rejected the accusation and demanded that India present evidence to support its claim. Islamabad has also called for a “neutral investigation” in to the Kashmir attack.', 'Shukla, a former Indian Army officer, however, said a pullout by Pakistan from the Simla Agreement would not automatically amount to a declaration of war. Still, it would bring the neighbours closer to a potential military conflict.', '“One does not automatically lead to another, but it does mean that both sides will no longer have guardrails of an international treaty that withholds them from engaging in armed hostilities,” he said.', 'Unlike its immediate implementation of other retaliatory measures, Pakistan has only threatened to walk out of the Simla Agreement.', 'According to Soofi, Pakistan’s rationale stems from a desire to return to multilateralism.', '“India has used Simla to argue that Kashmir is a purely bilateral issue. Suspending it allows Pakistan to revert to UN Security Council mechanisms to internationalise the Kashmir dispute,” Soofi said.', 'Shukla said suspending the agreement could provide international cover for both sides to pursue their interests on the LoC in a manner not possible while adhering to the pact.', '“Pakistan always sort of held to the notion that treaties like the Simla Agreement have tied its hands from pursuing its interests in places like Siachen, which Pakistan says is an example of India violating the agreement,” he said. India successfully captured the strategically located Siachen Glacier in 1984 in a military operation that Pakistan insists violated the Simla Agreement.', 'Meanwhile, India also feels hobbled by the agreement, Shukla said. New Delhi has long insisted that Pakistan-administered Kashmir belongs to India, and under Modi, the domestic rhetoric to militarily take back that territory has grown.', '“In essence, both sides feel the agreement is not safeguarding their interests,” said Shukla.', 'Ahmad suggests that India’s suspension of the IWT could already constitute an act of aggression under international law, justifying self-defence measures by Pakistan. Under the IWT, India gets the waters of the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej rivers, all part of the Indus Basin. On the other hand, Pakistan is entitled to most of the water from the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab rivers.', '“The water treaty underpins the lives of nearly 250 million Pakistanis.

However, every EU member state except Malta raised its defence budget, reflecting an increasingly widespread Russian threat perception.', 'The relaxed EU deficit rules, known as Rearm Europe, along with a 150-billion-euro ($170bn) fund to boost EU defence products and a German parliament decision last month to devote up to 1 trillion euros ($1.14 trillion) to infrastructure and defence all advocated in favour of what Krummrich predicted.', 'Experts cautioned that expenditure would take a long time to translate into force projection.', '“Major military capability takes years to develop,” said Lukas Milevski, a lecturer in international studies at Leiden University. “It takes time to train people, to buy the stuff, to build the stuff, to deliver the stuff,” he told Al Jazeera.', 'Germany, for example, promised Lithuania a brigade in 2022. Its barracks are built in southwest Lithuania, but the brigade is not expected to be manned, trained, equipped and operational until the end of 2027.', 'Milevski also cautioned that the money would have to be sustained over many years. “By the time you actually need to pay for the stuff, all those exemptions that came with Rearm Europe have expired, and the year-by-year continuation doesn’t provide the stability that defence policy needs,” he said.', 'Another concern is what the money is spent on. The staggering US defence budget of $997bn, for example, is often described as bloated with pork-barrel procurements rather than what a modern military needs.', 'Europe suffers from a similar problem of redundancy, with different states competing to have their tank or rocket launch system adopted as the EU standard and funded to great heights.', 'Krummrich believed the EU now enjoys a “significant opportunity” to avoid squabbling about which older systems to preserve, and “leap forward technologically through military innovation and investment”. It was enough, he said, to observe how “the dirt laboratory of Ukraine has revealed a new evolution in warfare, especially regarding drones and unmanned vehicles”.', 'Others expressed concern about Europe’s go-it-alone approach.', '“It’s capabilities that matter, and how those capabilities are built and controlled,” said Hugo Bromley, an economy and geopolitical expert at Cambridge University’s Centre for Geopolitics.', 'The US and Europe should not be decoupling, but working together to provide specific needs in both Europe and the Asia Pacific, Bromley told Al Jazeera.', '“The scarce assets America needs, particularly in an Indo-Pacific focus, are the very high-end [air]lift, missiles – capabilities that the current focus of European expenditure is not designed to create … because these are the capabilities that nation states wish most to keep to themselves,” he said.', '“So we need to have an honest conversation about which countries are prepared to work together on these issues … and if you look at where our natural partners are to develop those high end capabilities, it is East Asia, Germany, to a lesser extent France and Britain, and what I think of as Commonwealth – so Australia, Canada.”', 'This internationalist approach is currently out of favour on the continent, where the concept of strategic autonomy now drives renewed European defence resolve.', 'Finally, there is concern that money, even if effectively spent over sufficient time to deliver force, is going to lead to tragedy in the Ukrainian theatre, which is largely depleted of its professional militaries.', '“The operational map remains largely stagnant,” said Krummrich.', '“Gone are the highly trained troops and great campaign plans.

The attack exposed holes in its approach, analysts say.', 'New Delhi, India —Addressing a rally of supporters in September 2024, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi confidently asserted that his Hindu majoritarian Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would create a new Jammu and Kashmir, “which would not only be terror-free but a heaven for tourists”.', 'Seven months later, that promise lies in tatters. On April 22, an armed groupkilled 25 touristsand a local pony rider in the resort town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, setting off an escalatory spiral in tensions between India and Pakistan, which New Delhi accuses of links to the attackers – a charge Islamabadhas denied.', 'The armies of the two nuclear-armed neighbours haveexchanged gunfirefor three days in a row along their disputed border. India has suspended its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) that Pakistan counts on for its water security, and Islamabad has threatened to walk out of past peace deals. Both nations have also expelled each other’s diplomats, military attaches and hundreds of civilians.', 'But India is simultaneously waging a battle on territory it controls. In Indian-administered Kashmir, security forces areblasting the homesof families of suspected armed fighters. They have raided the homes of hundreds of suspected rebel supporters and arrested more than 1,500 Kashmiris since the Pahalgam killings, the deadliest attack on tourists in a quarter of a century.', 'Yet, as Indian forces comb dense jungles and mountains to try to capture the attackers who are still free, international relations experts and Kashmir observers say the past week has revealed major chinks in Modi’s Kashmir policy, which they say appears to be staring at a dead end.', 'The Pahalgam attack “punctured the balloon of the ‘New Kashmir’ narrative”, said Sumantra Bose, a political scientist whose work focuses on the intersection of nationalism and conflict in South Asia.', 'In August 2019, the Modi government withdrew the semi-autonomous status of Indian-administered Kashmir without consultation with either the political opposition or Kashmiris. That special status had been a critical condition for Kashmir to join India following independence from the British in 1947.', 'The Modi government argued that successive governments had failed to truly integrate Jammu and Kashmir with the rest of India, and that the semi-autonomous status had played into the hands of secessionist forces that seek to break the region from India.', 'The abrogation of the constitutional provision that gave Kashmir its special status was accompanied by a major crackdown. Thousands of civilians were arrested, including leaders of mainstream political parties – even those that view Kashmir as a part of India. Phone and internet connections were shut off for months. Kashmir was cut off from the rest of the world.', 'Yet, the Modi government argued that the pain was temporary and needed to restore Kashmir to what multiple officials described as a state of “normalcy”.', 'Since then, the arrests of civilians, including journalists, have continued. Borders of electoral constituencies were changed in a manner that saw Jammu, the Hindu-majority part of Jammu and Kashmir, gain greater political influence than the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley. Non-Kashmiris have been issued residency cards – which was not allowed before 2019 – to settle there, sparking fears that the Modi government might be attempting to change the region’s demography.', 'And though the region held the first election to its provincial legislature in a decade in late 2024, the newly elected government of Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has been denied many of the powers other regional governments enjoy – with New Delhi, instead,\\xa0 making key decisions.', 'Amid all of that, the Modi government pushed tourism in Kashmir, pointing to a surge in visitors as evidence of the supposed normalcy that had returned to the return after four decades of armed resistance to Indian rule. In 2024, 3.5 million tourists visited Kashmir, comfortably the largest number in a decade, according to government figures.', 'But long before the Pahalgam attack, in May 2024, Abdullah – now, the chief minister of the region, then an opposition leader – had cautioned against suggesting that tourism numbers were reflective of peace and stability in Kashmir.', '“The situation [in Kashmir] is not normal and talk less about tourism being an indicator of normalcy; when they link normalcy with tourism, they put tourists in danger,” Abdullah said in May last year. “You are making the tourists a target.”', 'Al Jazeera reached out to Abdullah for a comment on the current crisis but has yet to receive a response.', 'On April 22, that Modi government narrative that Abdullah had warned about was precisely what left the meadows of Pahalgam splattered in blood, said Praveen Donthi, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group. “New Delhi and its security agencies started buying their own assessment of peace and stability, and they became complacent, assuming that the militants will never attack tourists,” he said.', 'Until the Pahalgam attack, armed fighters had largely spared tourists in Kashmir, keeping in mind their importance to the region’s economy, noted Donthi. “But if pushed to the wall, all it takes is two men with guns to prove that Kashmir is not normal,” he said.', 'On April 8, just two weeks before the attack, Indian Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah, who is widely seen as Modi’s deputy, was in Srinagar, Kashmir’s largest city, to chair a security review meeting. Abdullah, the chief minister, was not a part of the meeting – the most recent instance where he has been kept out of security reviews.', 'Analysts say this underscores that the Modi government views Kashmir’s security challenges almost exclusively as an extension of its foreign policy tensions with Pakistan, not as an issue that might also need domestic input for New Delhi to tackle it successfully. India has long accused Pakistan of arming, training and financing the armed rebellion against its government in Indian-administered Kashmir. Pakistan claims it only offers moral and diplomatic support to the secessionist movement.', 'The Pahalgam attack has shone a light on the folly of the Modi administration’s approach, Donthi said.', '“Projecting this as a security crisis that is being fuelled entirely by Pakistan can make it useful politically, domestically, but it’s not going to help you resolve the conflict,” he said.', '“Unless the Indian government starts engaging with the Kashmiris, there can never be a durable solution to this violence.”', 'So far, though, there is little evidence that the Modi government is contemplating a shift in approach, which appears shaped “to cater to domestic jingoism and hyper-nationalist rhetoric”, Sheikh Showkat, a Kashmir-based political commentator, said.', 'The focus since the Pahalgam attack has been to punish Pakistan.', 'Since 1960, the IWT – the water-sharing agreement between India and Pakistan – survived three wars and has been widely hailed as an example of managing transnational waters.', 'Under the treaty, both countries get water from three rivers each, from the Indus Basin: three eastern rivers – the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej – to India, while three western rivers – the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab – carry 80 percent of water to Pakistan.', 'But the future of that pact is uncertain with India suspending its participation in the treaty after the Pahalgam attack. Pakistan has responded by warning that attempts to stop or divert water resources would amount to “an act of war”. Islamabad has also warned that it might suspend its participation in all bilateral treaties, including the 1972 Simla Agreement, signed after their 1971 war, which in essence demarcates the Line of Control, the de-facto border, between them.', '“Pakistan genuinely views this matter [the loss of water] in existential and even apocalyptic terms,” said Bose, the political scientist. “India knows this – and it signals a policy of collective punishment towards Pakistan, which impacts tens of millions of people.”', 'However, experts have raised several questions about India’s and Pakistan’s announcements.', 'How can India practically stop water when it does not have the capacity to hold these powerful rivers? Can it divert water, risking flooding in its own territory? And if Pakistan walks away from the Simla Agreement, is it in effect signalling a state of war?', '“All of these measures are juvenile, on both sides,” said Bose, but with “concrete implications”.', 'For its part, India has been seeking to renegotiate the IWT for several years, claiming that it does not get its fair share of the water. “The recent Kashmir crisis gives [New] Delhi an opportunity, a pretext to pull the trigger on the treaty,” said Showkat, the Kashmiri-based commentator.', 'Two days after the Pahalgam attack, Modi was touring Bihar, the eastern state due for elections later this year. Addressing an election rally, the prime minister said that he would chase the attackers “to the end of the earth”.', 'To Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a Modi biographer, such speeches are reflective of what he argues is the sole objective of Modi’s Kashmir policy: “maximising the core electoral constituency of the BJP in the rest of the country by being tough on Kashmir”.', 'Since independence, the BJP’s ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, has viewed Kashmir as an unfinished project: The RSS for decades called for the region’s special status to be scrapped, and for a firm security-driven approach to the Muslim-majority region.', '“Now, the only thing is, ‘We want revenge’,” said Mukhopadhyay, referring to the jingoism that currently dominates in India.', 'Since the attack, several Kashmiris have been beaten up across India, with landlords pushing out tenants and doctors turning away Muslim patients. Social media platforms are rife with inflammatory content targeting Muslims.', 'The International Crisis Group’s Donthi said that the Pahalgam attack, in some ways, serves as “a shot in the arm” for Modi’s government. While the security challenges in Kashmir and the crisis with Pakistan represent strategic and geopolitical tests, “domestically, it is a great position for the Modi government to be in”.', 'He said this was especially so with a weak opposition largely falling in line – the principal opposition Congress party has backed a muscular response to Pakistan for the attack.', 'However, Bose, the political scientist, argues that the Modi government was not focused on short-term political calculations. Modi’s comments in Bihar, and the largely unchecked hate against Kashmiris and Muslims spreading across Indian social platforms and on TV channels, were reflective of the BJP’s broader worldview on Kashmir, he said.', 'Kashmir is an ideological battle for Modi’s party, he said, adding, “This government is never going to change its Kashmir policy.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

Hopefully, they are still alive,” she said, standing next to a whiteboard showing the tally of 73 people that were still missing under the rubble of the unfinished 30-storey building, which was designed to house Thailand’s National Audit Office.', 'The earthquake that rocked the Thai capital was particularly shallow, just 10km (6.2 miles) deep, which intensified the shock waves on the earth’s surface.', 'Though situated more than 1,200km (750 miles) from the epicentre inMyanmar where thousands died, the earthquake brought Bangkok to a standstill. Panicked residents of this city of more than 11 million people rushed out into the streets in search of safety as buildings swayed and shuddered.', 'A month on, life in the Thai capital has returned to normal.', 'But the dozens of deaths – most of which were at the site of the collapsed audit office building – and the shock of the events of March 28 have prompted concerns for some in Bangkok about the safety of high-rise living in the world’s 12th tallest city.', 'A sudden feeling of nausea and the swaying of lamps inside his apartment on the ninth floor of a 41-storey building told Harry Yang he was in danger.', '“I ran out onto my balcony and everything was shaking,” said the 29-year-old, who has called Bangkok his home since birth.', '“People were screaming,” he said.', 'Dashing down the fire escape stairs, Yang immediately thought of his ageing father who lives on the 32nd floor in another high-rise building in Bangkok and who has issues with mobility.', 'Although his father, who works as an antique dealer, made it out of the ordeal unscathed, the quake destroyed many of his antiques and left him terrified.', '“My dad is 68 years old, he has leg problems, and he needed to climb down” stairs to reach the ground floor, Yang said.', 'People had good reason to be scared. Video clips on social media showed Bangkok shaking, with debris falling to the ground and water pouring in torrents from skyscraper infinity swimming pools.', 'Lapaphutch Lertsachanant was in her condominium on the 27th floor when the quake struck.', '“The building was literally moving side to side. I really felt at that moment that the building could be cut in half,” Lapaphutch said.', '“I really thought that I wouldn’t survive,” she added, recalling her desire to speak to her partner one final time by phone. “I thought I could have my last words with him. He would be with me in my last moments alive.”', 'Although seismic events in the wider Southeast Asia region are common, the scale of the quake that hit Myanmar – where more than 3,700 people were killed – and shook Bangkok took many by surprise.', 'Wang Yu, associate professor in the department of geosciences at the National Taiwan University, said Myanmar lies directly on a tectonic fault line, the Sagaing Fault, and the March 28 quake occurred after a strike-slip fault between the India and Eurasian plates.', 'According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), a strike-slip refers to a tectonic fault where two plates move horizontally past each other. Since 1900, the USGS reports that six other large earthquakes with a magnitude of 7.0 or more have occurred within 250km (155 miles) of the epicentre in Myanmar of the March 28 quake.', 'Bangkok is built on a basin of unstable soil that can increase the effect of these quakes, Wang Yu explained.', '“When a seismic wave transmits from the outside into the basin, the amplitude of the seismic wave will be enlarged,” he said.', 'But the precise reason why the building in central Bangkok collapsed remains under investigation. No other building in Bangkok suffered such a catastrophic failure, although many sustained structural damage. Officials in Thailand have launched an investigation to assess whether proper building protocols were followed.', 'Thailand first introduced seismic regulations on buildings in 1997. In 2007, new legislation specified that buildings higher than 15 metres (49ft) in high-risk areas like Bangkok must be built to withstand quakes of up to magnitude 7.0. Two years later, in 2009, the Thai Department of Public Works and Town and Country Planning introduced a comprehensive “Standard for Earthquake Resistant Design of Buildings”.', 'Given these building and engineering regulations, questions have been raised over how the almost-constructed building in Bangkok could collapse.', '“I think we need to find the root cause so at least we can learn some lessons and improve building regulations,” Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt said shortly after the quake, as local authorities fanned out across Thailand to test buildings and assess whether they were still structurally sound.', 'So far, the majority have been deemed to meet safety standards.', 'On April 3, just six days after the earthquake, Bangkok’s Metropolitan Authority declared an end to the “disaster situation” in Bangkok, except for the building collapse site.', 'Now a month on from the disaster, some residents are still concerned as superficial cracks and other damage to their high-rise residences have contributed to lingering feelings of insecurity.', 'Despite engineers declaring that his apartment was safe to live in, 32-year-old Varuth Pongsapipatt found the series of cracks running up the walls of his apartment a little unsettling, but he was dealing with it.', '“It’s quite scary, but it has no effect on the structure of the building, so it’s OK,” he told Al Jazeera.', 'With the lift in her condominium out of commission after the quake, Lapaphutch said she was forced to move into her parents’ home for almost three weeks, and she was not in a rush to return to her 27th-floor place.', '“I don’t feel I’m safe going back to living in a tall building,” she said.', 'Harry Yang said his father had refused to return to his 32-floor home, worried that aftershocks may occur.', '“My parents are really concerned. My dad has been staying in a hotel since the earthquake happened,” Yang told Al Jazeera earlier this month.', 'Research by Thailand’s National Institute of Development Administration (NIDA) after the earthquake found that some 68 percent of respondents were concerned about the stability and safety of buildings.', 'For some, the effect on the property market was a worry, too.', '“I’m more concerned about property prices,” Yang said.', '“I think this will have a big impact on the property market and consumer confidence. A lot of people are trying to find a way to move out,” he said.', 'Following the quake, Thai financial analysts predicted that condominium sales could be hit with potential buyers thinking twice before purchasing a high-rise building in Bangkok, placing further pressure on the country’s property sector.', '“The March 28 earthquake is expected to create a windfall for low-rise houses, which are perceived as less vulnerable to seismic events. This trend will mirror the shift seen in 2011 when nationwide flooding led homebuyers to favour condos over low-rise houses,” the Bangkok Post newspaper reported earlier this month.', 'The quake also exposed serious shortcomings in Thailand’s emergency alert system.', 'Although an earthquake warning system was supposed to keep the Thai public updated with information, warning messages could only be sent out in batches of 200,000 at a time, creating a bottleneck that slowed down communications in a country of almost 72 million.', 'Harry Yang said neither he nor his parents received any emergency response messaging. They were forced to search online for information after the quake hit.', 'Weeks on from the quake, Bangkok resident Lapaphutch also said she had never received any emergency information.', '“We really need this kind of system that can alert us,” she said. “Everyone in Thailand should be reviewing these kinds of notifications to make us well prepared.”', 'The survey by NIDA showed that almost 60 percent of those polled were concerned about the effectiveness of the early warning systems. Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has since called for upgrades to the system to increase the broadcast capacity of the alert batches to 1 million at a time, according to local reports.', 'Despite the challenges, Thailand emerged from the tremor relatively unscathed.', 'Just metres from the site of the collapsed 30-storey building, Bangkok’s Chatuchak Weekend Market was already bustling with tourists just days after the quake, and the events seemed almost like a distant memory in a city that never really sleeps.', 'Harry Yang agreed.', 'Bangkok residents had initially felt scared, but that would pass, he said.', '“Eventually it’s going to come back to normal.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

The technique is named after the Wizard of Oz.', 'In the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, published in 1900, Frank Baum wrote about a man who uses tricks to fool the residents of the fictional land of Oz into thinking he’s a wizard. For instance, it is believed that the Emerald City, the capital of Oz, is so bright and vibrant that visitors have to wear special glasses to protect their eyes. The glasses are one of the wizard’s tricks, since they make the city appear greener and grander.', 'The human eye perceives colour via three types of photoreceptor or “cone cells” in the retina. S cones pick up shorter, blue wavelengths of light; M cones detect medium, green wavelengths; and L cones detect longer, red wavelengths.', '“The signals from these cones are then sent through a complex series of cells in the retina that act to clean up and integrate the signal before passing it down the optic nerve through parts of the brain,” Francis Windram, a research associate at the department of life sciences at Imperial College London, told Al Jazeera.', 'The part of the brain that the visual information is passed to is the visual cortex.', 'In normal vision, the function of M cones overlaps with the neighbouring S and L cones, so any light that stimulates M cones also activates the other two cones. The M cones don’t function alone.', '“There’s no wavelength in the world that can stimulate only the M cone,” Ren Ng, a professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley, explained in an article published on its website.', '“I began wondering what it would look like if you could just stimulate all the M cone cells. Would it be like the greenest green you’ve ever seen?”', 'So Ng teamed up with Austin Roorda, one of the creators of the Oz technology and a professor of optometry and vision science at UC Berkeley.', 'Oz, which Roorda described as “a microscope for looking at the retina”, uses tiny microdoses of laser light to target individual photoreceptors in the eye. The equipment, which must be highly stabilised during use, is already being used to study eye disease.', 'The work using Oz began in 2018 by James Carl Fong, a doctoral student in electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley. Hannah Doyle, another doctoral student at Berkeley, ran the experiments through which human subjects were able to see the new colour, olo.', 'The shade of olo has always existed, it just falls beyond the spectrum of shades visible to the human eye. There are other such shades that we cannot see. Hence, olo is not a new colour that has come into existence, from a physical or scientific perspective.', 'However, “from a sociolinguistic perspective, if people give new names to colours which previously were indistinguishable thanks to this technology, then maybe! It all depends on how you say it,” Windram said.', 'Five people have seen the “new” colour – four men and one woman. All had normal colour vision.', 'Three of the subjects, including Roorda and Ng, are the co-authors of the research paper while the other two are members of the participating lab at the University of Washington and were unaware of the purpose of the study before they took part.', 'Those who have seen olo describe it as a teal or green-blue colour – but one they had never seen before.', 'In the article by UC Berkeley, it is described as a “blue-green colour of unparalleled saturation”.', '“It was like a profoundly saturated teal … the most saturated natural colour was just pale by comparison,” Roorda said.', '“I wasn’t a subject for this paper, but I’ve seen olo since, and it’s very striking. You know you’re looking at something very blue-green,” Doyle said.', 'The researchers said an image of a teal square is the closest colour match to olo. However, this square is not an olo-coloured square. The naked human eye simply cannot see the shade.', '“If you start with the colour in that picture, and imagine dialling up the saturation further you would get to the teal of real peacock feathers, further still would be a laser in the teal wavelength, and far beyond that is olo, outside the natural space of human colors,” Ng told Al Jazeera.', '“We’re not going to see olo on any smartphone displays or any TVs any time soon. And this is very, very far beyond VR headset technology,” Ng said, according to a report in the UK’s Guardian newspaper.', 'Berkeley researchers are exploring whether the Oz technology could help people with colour blindness.', '“We are now studying the science of boosting the colour dimensionality of signals going from the eye to the brain,” Ng said. “If it proves possible for a colour blind person to see full colour, the next question is whether a person with full colour could be boosted to yet a higher dimension of colour called tetrachromacy.”', 'This could contain colours beyond the rainbow that would need new names. Ng said that this is part of an ongoing scientific inquiry.', 'Windram said success would depend on the cause of colourblindness in individuals. Deuteranomaly, which causes decreased sensitivity to green light, is the most common form of colour blindness.', '“In this case, a miniaturised version of this technology could theoretically be used to correct this by directly stimulating the cones when the correct colour of light hits them,” Windram said.', 'Windram pointed out that publicity materials for the research show images of the Oz experiment on a highly stabilised table.', '“This would require a lot of work to miniaturise the technology, and is likely a long way off. Given that the laser must stably hit the correct cones in order to stimulate them, this may not really be feasible as a form of vision correction technologically,” he said.', 'The concept of a colour has three main components, Windram explained: The physical, which has to do with the wavelengths of light that meet the eye; the neurological, which refers to how humans biologically process these light signals; and the societal or linguistic component, which pertains to how colours are named.', '“In the end I may see a colour and call it ‘red’, someone else may call it ‘rot’ or ‘rouge’ … but also another may look at it a bit more closely and say ‘well it’s claret’ or ‘crimson’.”', 'To test this, neuroscience and AI researcher Patrick Mineault developed awebsitefor entertainment purposes in September 2024, on which users can take a test to see how their colour perception compares to others.', 'Humans can also perceive colour differently due to differences in factors such as “temperature” of light. This was demonstrated when a photo of a dress went viral in 2015, dividing social media users over whether the dress was white and gold, or blue and black.', 'Windram explained that people who were deciding what colours the dress was were drawing on preconceived notions of whether the photograph of the dress was taken in warm lighting or cool lighting.', 'Yes, different species can experience colours differently.', 'For example, humans process three wavelengths corresponding to red, blue and green light, while the mantis shrimp, a tiny crustacean, can visually perceive 12 channels of colour instead of three. An article by the Australian Academy of Science explains that the mantis shrimp can also detect ultraviolet and polarised light, which humans cannot see.', 'However, while the human eye can mix two colours and perceive an in-between shade – such as purple as a mix of red and blue – the mantis shrimp’s eyes cannot mix colour receptors.', 'Meanwhile, dogs only have two types of cones and can mostly only see shades of yellow and blue.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

That trauma was clear when she and her husband travelled to Aurora, Colorado, last year to meet with Venezuelans living in the United States.', '“Everyone’s afraid,” said Tamayo, 69, who leads the Refugee Support Network. Among other services, her organisation helps foreign nationals apply for programmes like temporary protected status (TPS) and humanitarian parole — two categories that allow a temporary but legal stay in the US.', '“They were leaving because things were terrible there,” she said of the people she met in Colorado. “Most of them did not talk too much about it except to say that this was the chance for them to live here legally.”', 'TPS is a designation created by the US government in 1990 to shield foreign nationals already in the country from deportation to countries designated unsafe to return to. Humanitarian parole, meanwhile, allows people to enter the US temporarily, on the basis that they have an urgent humanitarian need.', 'But both categories have come under scrutiny during the second administration of US President Donald Trump.', 'Trump has pushed to limit immigration into the US, including by closing legal pathways like TPS and humanitarian parole.', 'In February, Trump announced that nearly 300,000 Venezuelans would be stripped of their TPS in early April. Then, in late March, his government announced plans to terminate humanitarian parole for approximately530,000 Venezuelans, Nicaraguans, Cubans and Haitians, effective Thursday.', 'But both efforts have faced legal challenges. In March, a US federal judge blocked the revocation of TPS, saying the Trump administration’s characterisation of the migrants as criminals “smacks of racism”. And on April 10, a different federal judge also issued a temporary order barring the elimination of the humanitarian parole programme.', 'Tamayo’s husband, Andres Pacheco, 64, told Al Jazeera that until now, TPS was a “relatively easy process” compared with asylum claims, but he worries that such temporary programmes may soon no longer be an option.', '“The only problem with TPS is that it only goes up to 18 months,” said Pacheco, who runs a legal aid nonprofit for immigrants in Texas. “So these are people who live in a state of uncertainty.”', 'Despite studies consistently showing that undocumented immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than US citizens, Trump cast migrant crime as a central point of his presidential campaign in 2024.', 'Trump also echoed unproven claims about Venezuela’sTren de Aragua gangduring campaign rallies, including at an October stop in Aurora, Colorado, where such fears had emerged. He went on to call the city a “warzone” and used the issue to attack Democrats and stoke voter fears, warning that “migrant criminals” would “rape, pillage, thieve, plunder and kill the people of the United States of America”.', '“Do you see what they’re doing in Colorado? They’re taking over,” Trump said at a rally in Pennsylvania. He added, without providing evidence: “They’re taking over real estate. They become real estate developers from Venezuela. They have equipment that our military doesn’t have.”', 'In the months that followed, Tamayo and Pacheco watched as Trump repeatedly spoke out againstVenezuelan President Nicolas Madurowhile, at the same time, describing Venezuelan immigrants as criminals. That portrait didn’t align with what Tamayo saw from the dozens of people they met in Aurora.', '“Their country had completely collapsed, and so they had no medicines, no food, no anything. And so they just had to leave.”', 'Despite Trump’s criticisms, many Venezuelans living in the US voted for the president.', 'Immigration advocates fear the court orders blocking the dissolution of programmes like TPS and humanitarian parole for Venezuelans are only temporary barriers for the Trump administration. They say that leaves hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans living legally in the US\\xa0grappling with uncertainty about their futures.', 'Other presidential actions have also compounded those fears. In March, the US flew more than 200 immigrants – alleged members of Tren de Aragua – to be imprisoned in El Salvador after Trumpcontroversially invokedwartime legislation to expel them.', 'Luis, a Venezuelan-American Trump voter living in Dallas, told Al Jazeera he “never thought” Trump would target relief programmes that keep more than half a million Venezuelans – including some of his loved ones – safe from deportation. He asked to use only his first name for fear of retribution against his family.', '“[Trump has] admitted Venezuela is not safe, and I understand he doesn’t want criminals,” said the 34-year-old. “But why does he want to get rid of honest, hardworking people? What does he want to send us back to?”', 'This is not the first time Trump has tried to end programmes like TPS.', 'During his first term, the president tried to strip TPS from people from El Salvador, Haiti and other nations he infamously dubbed“s***hole countries”.', 'Advocacy groups blocked him with lawsuits, and Marco Rubio, then a US senator and now Trump’s secretary of state, cosponsored theVenezuela TPS Act, which pushed to extend the protected status to citizens of the South American nation. Rubio also personally lobbied for Venezuelans in a letter to then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.', 'However, this year, Rubio took a new position on the matter.', '“Designating Venezuela under TPS does not champion core American interests or put America and American citizens first,” he wrote.', 'Few other Republicans have spoken up for Venezuelans at risk of losing their legal immigration status.', 'US Representative Maria Salazar from Miami, Florida, called on Trump not to “punish” immigrants by revoking their humanitarian parole. Salazar, a fellow Republican, blamed the previous administration of President Joe Biden for creating a “political mess” through his use of the temporary programmes.', 'More than 70 percent of Salazar’s constituents are Hispanic, and nearly one-fourth are not US citizens.', '“They came here fleeing failed communist countries believing in Biden’s empty promises,” Salazarwrote.', 'Recently, Salazar celebrated the courts blocking Trump’s manoeuvring, even going so far as to say she had “led the fight” to protect TPS. In reality, the fight has been led by groups like the National TPS Alliance, which filed the lawsuit that led to a federal court blocking Trump’s efforts to claw back the temporary status.', 'Jose Palma, a National TPS Alliance coordinator, said he’s counselled hundreds of TPS recipients.', '“We have stories of people from Honduras or El Salvador that have been in the United States for the last 25 years,” he said. “They are at risk of losing their immigration status and getting deported, even though they have established their life in the United States.”', 'Palma is particularly concerned about parents who are TPS beneficiaries and have started families in the US, which makes their children US citizens.', 'If they are ultimately deported, he said, “their kids will either need to stay in the United States without their parents, or they will be forced to go to another country”.', 'Liz, a native of El Salvador who is now in her 50s, arrived in the US in 2001 after a devastating earthquake.', 'Offering only her first name for fear of reprisals, Liz said she has since reapplied for TPS roughly a dozen times, and she calls the programme “a blessing for my life” that has allowed her to build a family and a life in a place she now considers her home.', 'Some fees have increased, and some documents have become more complicated, but the process has been reliable: You turn in the necessary forms, and as long as your country is on the list, you receive the status.', '“TPS is at least one piece of the many we need in order to exercise our rights,” Liz said.', '“Even if it’s temporary, it’s created a lot of good for the American public,” she added. “We have TPS holders who are faith leaders. We have TPS holders who are business owners providing employment to US citizens.”', 'Carmen, a 27-year-old Venezuelan living in Fort Worth, Texas, echoed Liz’s comments, calling TPS “a godsend” that helped her “start a life I didn’t know I would have”.', 'Sindy Mata, a 30-year-old community organiser in Fort Worth, has also counselled immigrants who received TPS or humanitarian parole.', 'She said that, since early this year, many under temporary status received emails from the Department of Homeland Security that began: “It is time for you to leave the United States.”', 'Part of the administration’s strategy is to encourage immigrants to start “self-deporting”.', 'But Mata said the Homeland Security Department’s emails were not always having that intended effect.', '“I know one person who, when they received the email, their first thought was, ‘Who else got this? Who else in the community needs advice or needs some help?’”', 'That’s when she worked to connect people with legal representation and organisations like Palma’s that are determined to keep TPS alive.', '“It’s a reminder,” she said, “that we need to stand up for each other.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

Pakistan refutes the allegations and says it only provides moral and diplomatic support to Kashmiri nationalism. It has said that India has not provided any evidence of Pakistan’s involvement in the Pahalgam attack, which has left the nuclear-armed neighbours locked in a tense standoff: New Delhi has walked out of awater-sharing treaty; both nations are expelling each other’s citizens and arescaling back the diplomatic strengthsof their missions in each other’s capitals.', 'But inside India, Kashmiris are bearing the brunt of the anger over Tuesday’s attack.', 'Nearly a dozen Kashmiris who spoke with Al Jazeera, all on condition of anonymity, said they have locked themselves inside their rooms in at least seven cities of India, and avoid any outside contact, including placing online orders or booking cabs.', 'Dar is a second-semester student of anaesthesia and operation theatre technology in Jalandhar.

With his term exams breathing down his neck, Dar said he has grown anxious and depressed. “I have forgotten everything that I have learnt in these months,” he said. “There is a constant uncertainty – I may stay non-attendant [at class]; go back to my home, I don’t know, my head just does not work.”', '“There is mistrust everywhere I look,” he said. “We are also cursed because our face and features give away our ethnicity.”', 'Soon after the attack, multiple survivor accounts emerged, suggesting that the gunmen separated the attacked tourists by religion. Of the 26 people killed, 25 were Hindu men.', 'But largely missed in the tornado of anti-Kashmiri and anti-Muslim hate that has taken over Indian social media since Tuesday, was the identity of the 26th person killed: a Kashmiri Muslim man who tried to stop the attackers from murdering the tourists.', '“Today’s India runs high on xenophobic propaganda and that has been unleashed for some years now; most of it is against Muslims,” said Sheikh Showkat, a political analyst and academic based in Kashmir.', '“Kashmiris bear a double weight: of being a Kashmiri – and a Muslim,” he said. “They are always the easy targets.”', 'Nearly 350km (217 miles) away from Jalandhar, in Dehradun, the capital of Uttarakhand state, the leader of a far-right Hindutva outfit issued a chilling warning on Tuesday.', '“We won’t wait for the government to take action … Kashmiri Muslims, leave by 10am, else you will face action you can’t imagine,” Lalit Sharma, the leader of the Hindu Raksha Dal said in a video statement. “Tomorrow, all our workers will leave their homes to give this treatment to Kashmiri Muslims.”', 'Similar warnings were soon hitting the social media feed of *Mushtaq Wani, a 29-year-old Kashmiri student in the city.', 'Pursuing his master’s in library science, Wani, who is older than most Kashmiri students in the city, started receiving panicked calls from others. “We took the threats seriously,” he said.', 'There is a history of violence against Kashmiris in the region: soon after the deadly suicide bombing attack in 2019 in Pulwama, which killed at least 40 paramilitary personnel, Kashmiri students were hunted down in Dehradun, beaten up, and forced back home. Several did not return to the city.', '“This is what our life is like,” Wani lamented. “This happens again and again – why cannot India finish the militants in one go? They have so many troopers and the [number of] militants [is] so less … someone kills someone and our lives are upended.”', 'Since the threats, Wani has coordinated at least 15 students’ travel back to Kashmir. As for himself, he is sitting tight, locked inside a friend’s home, preparing for his term exams from next week. “We are scared and do not feel safe, but if I miss my exams, I stand to lose a lot,” he said.', 'However, Wani said, he felt a little relieved after the police arrested Sharma, the far-right leader, and assured Kashmiri students that authorities would ensure their safety.', 'After videos of frightened Kashmiris, and of their physical assault in nearly half a dozen Indian cities, hit social media, Omar Abdullah, the newly elected chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, urged other state chiefs on X to ensure the safety of Kashmiris.', '“I request the people of India not to consider the people of Kashmir as their enemies,” Abdullah later told reporters. “What happened did not take place with our consent.

Yet it remains unclear who will eventually fill the post.', 'The aim is to prevent a power struggle after Abbas vacates his post – a scenario that Israel could exploit to cause the collapse of the PA, fully annexe the occupied West Bank and ethnically cleanse Gaza, experts told Al Jazeera.', 'Yet Dianna Buttu, a former legal adviser to the PLO, believes creating a vice president post in the PA will not avert a power struggle once Abbas is gone – rather, it could exacerbate conflict.', '“The more fragmented the PA becomes, the more it will create a power vacuum … and that vacuum will be filled by external actors and mainly by the Americans and Israelis,” she warned.', 'Abbas, 89, assumed control of the PLO and PA after Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat died in November 2004 and hasruled without a popular mandate since dissolving parliamentin 2007.', 'His Fatah party dominates the PA and PLO. The long-defunct parliament has faded away, andcritics have slammed Abbasfor seeming to undermine attempts to hold elections that could revive it.', 'In the absence of parliament, the PLO controls the succession, a task Abbas has postponed, including by decreeing last year that Rawhi Fattouh, head of the Palestinian National Council, would become interim president if the position became vacant suddenly until elections are held.', '“Abbas has put this off out of fear that if he brought anyone forward, then they would be a rival,” said Khaled Elgindy, a visiting scholar at Georgetown University’s Center for Contemporary Arab Studies.', 'The PA was created by the Oslo Peace Accords, signed by Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1993 and 1995.', 'Tasked with governing the West Bank and Gaza until a Palestinian state was created alongside Israel, the PA lost credibility among Palestinians as Israel’s occupation became more violent and oppressive, and land grabs for Israeli settlements continued.', 'Since Oslo, the population of settlements, illegal under international law, built on Palestinian land has risen from about 200,000 to more than 750,000.', 'In 2007, a violent split with Hamas in Gaza constrained the PA’s authority to the parts of the occupied West Bank that it had some limited control over.', 'The PA did manage to become the de facto Palestinian representative on the international stage, replacing the PLO.', 'But at home, Abbas’s popularity slipped as people’s suffering increased and the PA continued its security coordination with Israel, which was outlined in the Oslo Accords.', 'The PA is also seen to have failed to protect Palestinians from Israeli troops and settlers while using its authority to crack down on civil activists and opponents.', 'This has resulted in a situation in which whoever he appoints, “Abbas’s handpicked successor probably won’t win people over”, Elgindy told Al Jazeera.', 'The name suggested most often is Abbas’s close confidant and secretary-general of the PLO Executive Committee, Hussein al-Sheikh.', 'Al-Sheikh also heads the PA’s General Authority for Civil Affairs, which issues the Israeli-approved permits that enable a few Palestinians to navigate the movement restrictions Israel has implemented in the occupied West Bank.', 'Human rights groups and the International Court of Justice – the highest legal body in the world – see Israel’s movement restrictions against Palestinians as apartheid.', 'Sheikh’s long-standing relationship with the Israeli authorities has led critics to accuse him of acting as a liaison for the occupation.', '“Nobody likes him [among Palestinians],” said Omar Rahman, an expert on Israel-Palestine with the Middle East Council for Global Affairs. “[Al-Sheikh] is tainted by his relationship to Israel and perceptions [that he is embroiled in] massive corruption.”', 'The pressure on Abbas regarding succession has ebbed and flowed over the years, intensifying over recent months as Arab states push him to appoint a successor to prevent the PA from dissolving into chaos, analysts told Al Jazeera.', 'Egypt is particularly eager to ensure succession, according to Rahman.', 'In March, Egypt called and hosted an Arab League summit, during which it unveiled itsreconstruction plan for Gazato counter United States President Donald Trump’s proposal to ethnically cleanse Gaza and turn it into a “Middle East Riviera”.', 'Egypt was mentioned as one of the countries where Palestinians could be “moved to”, an idea it firmly rejected and countered with its reconstruction plan.', 'The proposal included creating a Palestinian technocratic administration, supervised by the PA, to oversee the reconstruction of the devastated enclave without displacing anyone.', 'The path to PA administration of Gaza is not at all clear, however, as both Hamas and Israel object to it – Hamas because it administers Gaza currently, while Israel has panned the PA as ineffective.', 'Abbas appears to have gone on the offensive,delivering angry broadsidesagainst Hamas during the meetings and blaming the group for allowing the continuation of Israel’s genocide in Gaza by not handing over captives and disarming.', 'However, many Arab states blame Abbas for failing to reconcile his Fatah faction with Hamas, making them eager to see a change of guard in the PA, according to Tahani Mustafa, an expert on Palestinian internal politics with the International Crisis Group', 'Since 2007, Fatah and Hamas havesigned several agreementsto heal their divisions after the fighting that split the Palestinian national movement.', '“I think there has been a lot of frustration [among Arab states] that [Abbas] has been more of a spoiler and obstacle to trying to get a united Palestinian front, which has given Israel a pretext to continue doing what it has been doing in Gaza,” Mustafa told Al Jazeera.', 'Instead of creating a new political post, Buttu believes Abbas should hold elections for Fatah, the PLO and the PA.', 'The last time voting was held was just before the conflict between Hamas and Fatah in 2006.Hamas won a huge majorityin those legislative elections.', 'The choice to create a new vice president post, she fears, won’t solve the legitimacy crisis or power vacuum once Abbas is gone, given what she\\xa0described as Abbas’s lack of political will to revive Palestinian institutions.', '“In typical fashion, Abbas is doing the bare minimum to get [Arab states] off his back,” she told Al Jazeera.', 'Elections, she acknowledged, could prove technically difficult due to Israel’s devastating war and genocide in Gaza as well as its violence and movement restrictions in the West Bank.', 'However, she said Palestinians could still find ways to vote, perhaps through an online portal or process.', '“Inside Fatah itself, there is a lot of pushback on this appointment of a vice president.

World leaders,including United StatesPresident Donald Trump, are also expected at the Vatican to attend his funeral, which is slated for Saturday morning.', 'Unlike his predecessors, Francis requested a more modest burial. In 2024, he changed the longstanding burial rules that required three coffins – two made of cypress and oak, and one of lead, one inside the other. Under the new rules, popes can now be buried in a single coffin made of wood and lined with zinc. The rule change also allows for burial outside the Vatican, per Francis’s wishes.', 'His coffin will be transferred to the Basilica of St Mary Major, a church outside the Vatican’s walls, where he had asked for a simple tomb in the ground. Francis will be the first pope to be buried there since the 1600s, and the first in more than 100 years to be buried outside the Vatican.', 'Elected to the papacy in 2013, Francis was known for embracing a humble lifestyle. The Argentine-born pope chose to live in the Vatican guest house rather than the lavish Apostolic Palace, and often travelled in modest vehicles.', '“He always was more enthusiastic about going places where normal people lived, not the halls of power, the palaces and so on. That was very typical of him,” Massimo Faggioli, professor of Theology and Religious Studies at Villanova University in Pennsylvania, told Al Jazeera.', 'In his last will and testament released Monday, Francis said his burial would be covered by an unnamed benefactor whom he had previously arranged, and that would be sent to the Papal Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore.', '“It’s about symbols, because in Catholicism, symbols are very important, and this is one of those cases,” Faggioli added.', 'Vatican financial woes loom', 'The Vatican has been tight-lipped about the specific cost of Francis’s funeral and did not respond to requests for figures.', 'Historically, papal funerals have cost millions. In 1978, the deaths of two popes and the subsequent conclave cost the Vatican $20m – equivalent to more than $101m today. More recently, Pope John Paul II’s funeral in 2005, and his successor Pope Benedict XVI’s election, cost $9m (about $14.7m in today’s dollars).', 'That year, the Church brought in $12.4m in revenues from a tourist influx to its museums. Other sources of income include donations, stocks, bonds, real estate and other investments.', 'But in recent years, the Church has faced significant financial headwinds. Francis frequently clashed with cardinals over Church finances, including just three days before his hospitalisation in late February. He spearheaded a series of financial reforms – some of which sparked backlash – including cutting salaries for top-ranking officials.', 'Just last year, the Church had a $87m budget shortfall, the news agency Reuters reported, citing two sources familiar with the matter. The Vatican has not published a full budget since 2022.', '“The Vatican needs money, and it needs money because this is a much bigger church. Now it serves many more people in poor countries, and there are fewer Catholics in rich countries. And so that’s where the imbalance comes from,” Faggioli said.', 'The city of Rome, and the Vatican in particular, was already crowded due to Holy Week, which drew hundreds of thousands of visitors.', 'It remains unclear how many people will stay to mourn Francis’s passing or stay to attend the public viewing of his body, but thus far, tens of thousands havealready paid their respects.', 'Historically, the crowds have been vast. In 1978, an estimated 100,000 people gathered to mourn Paul VI. In 2005, Pope John Paul II brought in an estimated four million mourners to Rome for his funeral.

But others returned and rebuilt a tourist haven – a status that’s now dividing the village.', 'Langtang, Nepal– On the morning of April 25, 2015, Nima Chhiring Tamang, 30, left his home in northern Nepal’s Langtang village to spend time with friends in the neighbouring village of Kyanjin Gompa – about a three hour walk through the Himalayas, in the shadow of the towering 7,234-metre (13,733-foot) Langtang Lirung peak.', 'Chhiring had recently completed his university education in the capital, Kathmandu, a three-day walk combined with an eight-hour drive away, and returned to his home in the mountains.', 'Chhiring was playing cards with his friends when a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck the region, triggering a glacial avalanche that engulfed his village below. His mother, Karmu Tamang, was killed, along with nearly 300 others in Langtang, and 9,000 throughout the country. The avalanche brought an estimated 40 million tons of rock and ice bearing down on the village, carryinghalf the forceof an atomic bomb and reducing the village to rubble.', 'Only one building was left standing, a single house sheltered under a rock face.', 'Ten years later, Langtang is bustling with life again, serving as a popular trekking destination for tourists from all over the world. Grazing yaks greet hikers as they walk beneath strings of prayer flags, pausing to examine the earthquake memorial – stacks of stones etched with Buddhist mantras, honouring the lives lost in the tragedy.', 'The village falls within the Langtang National Park, which was established in 1976 to protect the region’s rare and endemic flora and fauna. That led to a spike in tourism to the region in the 1980s, forever altering the lives of Indigenous inhabitants within the park’s boundaries.', 'But the village lacked significant facilities to host the steady stream of tourists.', 'Following the earthquake, Langtang embraced tourism-driven development, with nearly every house in the village turning into a guesthouse with modern amenities, including WiFi for those tourists who want to embrace the wild while retaining the comforts of home.', 'Yet some residents now express dismay that the village is unrecognisable, both aesthetically and culturally. Anxious locals worry that the rebuilding came at the expense of social cohesion in the village and led to communities abandoning traditional activities, like yak herding and\\xa0foraging for medicinal plants.', '“Everyone here only cares about money and hotels now. There’s lots of competition for tourists. Before life was simple, and there was peace,” said Chhiring. While Langtang had been welcoming tourists before the earthquake, the atmosphere was more communal and supportive, and families didn’t push to get tourists into their guesthouses, he explained.', 'In the aftermath of the quake, international aid poured into Nepal, with a host of development organisations implementing a top-down approach and dictating the rebuilding process – how, when, where, and what to rebuild. The Asian Development Bank committed more than $600m to “build back better.”', 'But aid was often delivered in the form of loans with interest and other strings, leaving Nepal increasingly indebted.', 'Yet in Langtang, due to both its isolation and the determination of residents, the rebuilding efforts were largely organised by grassroots efforts, chiefly the Langtang Management and Reconstruction Committee – a community-led effort formed three months after the quake to facilitate rebuilding and raise funds. The committee was formed among the Langtangpa, the people of Langtangpa Valley – which contains around twenty-five villages, but with Langtang Village bearing the brunt of the disaster – who were living as refugees in Kathmandu and wished to facilitate a quick return to their land.', '“In the weeks that followed the earthquake, government authorities said maybe the Langtangpa wouldn’t be able to return,” explained Austin Lord, an anthropologist who was hiking in Langtang at the time of the earthquake and later published a dissertation at Cornell University on the disaster and its aftermath. “This sparked a strong desire to self-organise, which ultimately proved quite successful.”', 'But locals didn’t have enough funding to build separate homes and businesses, so they combined the two projects, explained Lhakpa Tamang, secretary of the reconstruction committee.', 'That’s when problems began to arise, he suggested.', '“With business, jealousy comes. Who’s gonna do better? Who is gonna earn more?” quipped Lhakpa. Quarrels happened over the size of prospective guesthouses, and community ties faltered. “There are always two sides of tourism: good and bad. Development sacrifices culture, but at the end of the day, people need money.”', 'Today, with nearly every building in Langtang Village is a guesthouse, families often sleep in the common room around a wood-burning stove during the peak seasons: March to May and September to November. Before the quake, the village mostly consisted of scattered tea houses, built with organic materials, primarily stone and timber. The landscape of Langtang is now dominated by concrete buildings with modern amenities, some rising three storeys tall from the ashes.', 'Still, the guesthouses brought badly needed income to families like that of Nurchung Tamang.', 'After losing everything, Nurchung, who now operates the Chhomo Valais Guest House in Langtang, told the story of how his family was evacuated to Kathmandu after the earthquake, but eventually decided to return to the rubble. The capital city was inundated with a wave of refugees fleeing the devastation across the countryside.', '“We had no money in Kathmandu, so we stayed at the monastery with the monks,” said Nurchung. The people of Langtang Valley migrated from Tibet about a thousand years ago, and they are devout Buddhists in a Hindu-majority country, roughly 9 percent of the population.', 'After years of living in poverty in Kathmandu, families began trickling back into the devastated Langtang Valley. “There was nothing left at first, so we planted barley and potatoes and stayed in tents and did what we could to earn income,” explained Nurchung.', 'Nurching’s family started their rebuilding efforts with the help of foreign volunteers who had previously visited Langtang – that families with fewer international friends and connections received less external help was another source of contention – but obtaining materials was not straightforward. Langtang Village is a three-day hike from the closest road and sits at an elevation of 3,430 meters (11,253 feet), high enough to induce altitude sickness, especially during strenuous physical activity. Construction materials had to be carried on the backs of porters, strapped to mules, or flown in with helicopters at huge expense.', 'Large machinery cannot be carried in at all, leaving the old Langtang Village still largely buried beneath the rubble. Instead of attempting to excavate the debris, a new village was constructed nearby. Because the village sits within Langtang National Park, the Langtangpa had limited space to expand. Residents were forced to rebuild in a cramped area free of avalanche debris and compete for space for their guesthouses.', 'Before the disaster, there were approximately 50 families in Langtang Village. Today, fewer than half remain. Some were killed, others moved away. Money was scarce and people were desperate, leaving much of the rebuilding process to be dictated by efforts to rapidly develop income-generating tourism infrastructure, as opposed to daily necessities like healthcare facilities, which have not been built in the village 10 years later. Today, there is a small clinic in neighbouring Mundu, but facilities are basic, and it is staffed by only a paramedic.', '“There is an unfortunate trickle-down effect with aid, with it often not reaching where it’s needed,” explained Cherie Rezen, a US nurse who is leading a two-day healthcare mission to the village for the anniversary of the disaster. Rezen and Dr Amar Raut, co-founders of the NGO Embrace Nepal, are planning on doing health screenings for residents and carrying in a variety of heavy medical equipment with them, including an ECG machine. The elderly, in particular, rely on these health camps for medical care, as it is challenging for them to leave Langtang Valley.', 'Today, foreign tourists embarking on the roughly six-day Langtang Trek are beckoned into one newly built guesthouse after the next. Tenacious women with long black braids in traditional Tamang dress – the Tamang are one of Nepal’s 142 recognised ethnic groups and the majority of the population of the valley – hand out printed business cards for their guesthouses. With snow-capped peaks in the backdrop, signs across the valley read: “We have hot showers and Western food at no extra cost!”', '“The disaster definitely accelerated the transition away from agro-pastoral livelihoods to a heavy dependence on the tourist economy,” said Lord.', 'The yak herders are dying out, and the next generation is more focused on gaining education that was inaccessible to their parents and grandparents, with many young Langtangpa opting to move to Kathmandu or go abroad to study. About 8 percent of Nepal’s population lives outside the country, driven away by a poor economy and a lack of job prospects. Many are enticed to stay only by carving out a role in the country’s tourism industry.', '“Langtang had almost no tourism 50 years ago. Our grandmothers made us clothes with yak wool. Life was happier before, but this is the way of life now. When you need to go forward and develop, going back is not possible,” explained Lkhapa, the rebuilding secretary, who is a resident of the neighbouring Kyanjin Gompa.', 'Today, he hands out fresh cinnamon rolls to tourists in luxury alpine gear while recounting his role in recovery efforts, retrieving bodies when the snow finally melted.', '“Langtangpas did the best they could to build back, and, after all their suffering, they built a new version of Langtang based on what they thought would bring them material security. They also built a version of Langtang for the future generation to come back and take over – most think a vibrant tourism economy is the best way to ensure their children come home.”', 'Climate change continues to threaten the survival of the village. A 2024 study found thatit exacerbatedthe impacts of the avalanche, and the village faces increasingly warming temperatures and erratic snowfall. When asked why return at all, Chhiring thought for a moment and responded: “It’s our motherland, we have to respect that.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

While the World Bank has a role in appointing neutral experts and arbitrators, it is not an enforcement authority.”', 'Khan explained that if Pakistan wanted to pursue legal recourse, it would likely be through international forums such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ). “In practice, the main costs for India would be reputational and strategic: undermining its image as a rules-based actor, especially given its own status as a downstream riparian on other transboundary rivers.”', 'Khan said that the broader strategic goal of the IWT suspension seems to be a renegotiation of the treaty. “India has been signalling its desire to revise or renegotiate the treaty for some time,” he said, explaining that India had asked to renegotiate the treaty in January 2023 and again in September 2024, citing climate change and implementation challenges.

It has also suspended all trade with India “including to and from any third country through Pakistan” – in effect saying that it won’t allow India to export to Afghanistan through its territory.', 'In the past, Pakistani officials have warned that India’s interference in water flow to Pakistan would be deemed an act of war, prompting retaliation.', 'In 2016, the then-chairman of Pakistan’s Senate, Raza Rabbani, said: “Interference with Pakistan’s water supply will be tantamount to an act of aggression and aggression will be met by aggression.”', 'The suspension of the IWT is significant. While India has threatened to suspend it before, it has never actually gone through with its threat.', 'In 2016, suspected rebel fighters killed 17 Indian soldiers in the Uri area in Indian-administered Kashmir. Four suspected rebels were also killed by the Indian army during this attack. In the aftermath of the Uri attack, Modi said: “blood and water can’t flow together” when discussing the IWT with government officials. However, the IWT was not suspended after this.', 'In 2019, a suicide bomber killed 40 paramilitary police in Indian-administered Kashmir’s Pulwama. This attack was claimed byJaish-e-Muhammad, an armed group based in Pakistan. In the aftermath, Indian Water Resources Minister Nitin Gadkari threatened to suspend the flow of water to Pakistan.

The funding freeze came amid US government efforts to crack down on student protesters and pressure universities into dropping diversity, equity and inclusion programmes.', 'On March 10, the US Department of Education announced it hadsent letters to 60higher education institutions, warning them of “enforcement actions” if they did not protect Jewish students on campus as stipulated in the Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The letters also quoted Secretary of Education Linda McMahon saying, “US colleges and universities benefit from enormous public investments funded by US taxpayers. That support is a privilege and it is contingent on scrupulous adherence to federal anti-discrimination laws.”', 'Shortly after, the Trump administration began freezing federal funding for some of the country’s top institutions, threatening research that universities say is critical for medical and scientific advancement.', 'In particular, the Trump administration is targeting institutions wherestudents participatedin pro-Palestine protests last year, alleging that the student protesters spread anti-Semitic sentiment on campus.', 'A day after Harvard filed its lawsuit, leaders and representatives of more than 200 American universities issued a joint statement accusing the Trump administration of political interference. The statement was signed by presidents and directors of some of the top-tier institutes in the country, including Princeton, Brown, Harvard, Columbia, Northwestern University and Pomona College.', 'So, what is going on in terms of federal funding on US campuses, and can universities survive these cuts?', 'On April 11, the US Department of Education, Department of Health and Human Services, and the General Services Administrationco-signed a letterto Harvard claiming that “Harvard has in recent years failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment.”', 'The letter made a series of demands of the university, including that the institution end all affirmative action in faculty hiring and student admissions, and that it change its admissions criteria to exclude international students “hostile to the American values”, including “students supportive of terrorism or anti-Semitism”. This was a follow-up to aseparate letterthe government had sent Harvard on April 3, demanding that the university reform any academic departments deemed to be fuelling “antisemitic harassment”. These departments, the letter said, “must be reviewed and necessary changes made to address bias, improve viewpoint diversity, and end ideological capture”.', 'In response, Harvard rejected the demands, saying that while some demands were aimed at targeting anti-Semitism, “the majority represent direct governmental regulation of the ‘intellectual conditions’ at Harvard.”', 'Hours after Harvard rejected the demands, an Education Department task force to tackle anti-Semitism released a statement announcing that \\xa0$2.3bn in federal funding to the university had been frozen.', 'Harvard’s president, Alan Garber, and fellows of Harvard College have now filed a lawsuit (PDF) in the US District Court in Massachusetts against leaders of the US Department of Education, Department of Health and Human Services, General Services Administration, Department of Energy, Department of Defense, National Science Foundation and National Aeronautics and Space Administration.', 'In a statement issued on Monday, Garber wrote: “We filed a lawsuit to halt the funding freeze because it is unlawful and beyond the government’s authority.”', 'The suit says that “the federal Government has launched a broad attack on the critical funding partnerships” which make it possible for Harvard and other American universities to carry out “invaluable research” in the fields of medicine, engineering and artificial intelligence (AI) which is crucial for finding solutions for space travel and for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and cancer, among other things.', 'The lawsuit also alleges that the funding freeze is unlawful because it infringes on First Amendment rights, which guarantee the freedom of speech.', '“This case involves the Government’s efforts to use the withholding of federal funding as leverage to gain control of academic decision-making at Harvard,” the lawsuit states.', 'TheTuesday joint statementco-signed by hundreds of American university leaders states: “We will always seek effective and fair financial practices, but we must reject the coercive use of public research funding.”', 'The frozen federal funds to Harvard include $2.2bn in grants and $60m in contracts. However, more money is at stake. In March, the Trump administration announced that it wouldreview $9bn of fundingto Harvard.', 'The administration has also threatened to revoke Harvard’s tax exempt status and its ability to enrol foreign students. In the Monday statement, Garber also wrote that the Trump administration has considered taking steps to freeze an additional $1bn in grants.', 'In February, the Trump administration froze $400m of funding to Columbia University, which emerged as the epicentre of pro-Palestine campus protests in 2024. The government cited what it called the institution’s “failure to protect Jewish students from anti-Semitic harassment”.', 'On March 19, Trump froze more than $175m in federal funding to his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, citing the allowance of transgender women to play women’s sports.', 'Some universities have reported receiving “stop work” orders, which are instructions to suspend all work on specific research projects supported by public funding.', '“American universities receive two main funding sources from the federal government. The first is financial aid for students, which flows to thousands of colleges. The second is research funding, which is heavily concentrated at about 200 universities,” Robert Kelchen, a professor and department head at the Department of Educational Leadership and Policy Studies at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, told Al Jazeera.', '“The American government has relied on universities to conduct research to benefit the country since World War II, and universities have built an infrastructure around that. The magnitude of American research funding has been unmatched around the world during this period,” said Kelchen.', 'Cornell University said it had received more than 75 “stop work” orders from the US Department of Defense, according to a statement released by Cornell President Michael I Kotlikoff and other university leaders on April 8.', 'The orders sent to Cornell relate to “research into new materials for jet engines, propulsion systems, large-scale information networks, robotics, superconductors, and space and satellite communications, as well as cancer research”, the university said.', 'The statement did not specify the amount of federal funding the projects subject to stop work orders were receiving. It also did not say why the government had issued these orders.', 'Northwestern University has also received stop work orders relating to roughly 100 federal grants, the university’s President Michael Schill and Chair of Board of Trustees Peter Barris wrote in a statement on Northwestern University’s website on April 17.', 'Earlier in April, US media outlets reported that the Trump administration had separately frozen more than $1bn in federal funding to Cornell University and $790m in funding to Northwestern University. The New York Times and CNN both claimed that an unnamed White House official had confirmed these funding freezes. “The money was frozen in connection with several ongoing, credible, and concerning Title VI investigations,” the official was quoted by CNN as saying.', 'However, both Cornell and Northwestern say they have not received notification of these funding freezes.', 'Many universities have sizeable endowment funds from which they can draw income each year to support research projects, scholarships and other expenses. An endowment is a series of funds or assets donated to a university to ensure that the institution is financially sustained in the future. Charitable donations from alumni, other donors and companies make up a huge part of endowments.', 'Harvard’s endowment was worth approximately $53.2bn in the 2024 fiscal year – the largest of any university. More than one-third of the research at Harvard is funded directly by the university, according to Harvard’s website.', 'Columbia’s endowment was $14.8bn for the fiscal year ending in June 2024. Cornell’s endowment was about $10.7bn in the fiscal year ending in June 2024. Northwestern University’s endowment amounted to approximately $14.3bn in 2024. University of Pennsylvania’s endowment was $22.3bn as of June 2024.', 'Some universities will be able to fall back on these endowments if federal funding freezes remain in place. “Universities typically spend about 5 percent per year out of their endowment, which provides funding for the Harvards of the world to make up for a loss of federal funding,” said Kelchen.', 'Endowments are subject to restrictions, however. “Endowment funds are heavily concentrated at a few dozen universities, and roughly three-fourths of all endowment funds are restricted for particular purposes,” Kelchen said, explaining that such purposes include student scholarships in very specific fields.', 'At Harvard, donors decide which programmes, departments and purposes 70 percent of the annual endowment distribution is spent on. Columbia’s website also states that the annual spending of the endowment is according to the wishes of the donors.', 'Universities have also seen a fall in the value of endowments. In 2024, Harvard’s donations dropped by $151m after some donors pulled funding from the university over the pro-Palestine protests and the university’s response to concerns about anti-Semitism on campus, according to an October 2024 report by the student-run newspaper, the Harvard Crimson.', 'Kelchen said that a few research universities may be able to make it through a period of several years without federal funding.', 'In its April 17 statement, for example, Northwestern University’s leadership wrote that for now, the university will continue to fund the research projects that are subject to stop work orders from the government. “This support is intended to keep these projects going until we have a better understanding of the funding landscape.”', 'Most universities will not be able to afford to this. Some, therefore, are acceding to government demands.', 'After receiving its own list of demands from the government on March 13, Columbia, for example,accepted these demandson March 18 and introduced new policies on campus. These new policies require protesting students to present their university identification if asked to do so. They also prohibit face masks intended to conceal a person’s identity. However, face coverings are still allowed for religious or medical reasons. Columbia also hired 36 security officers who have special powers to arrest students, and the university continues to rely on New York police for additional security assistance.', 'Some universities will try to seek other sources of funding, experts say.', '“Universities have been trying to diversify funding sources for years. The two most likely sources are increasing enrolment [to get more tuition dollars] and trying to generate more donations,” said Kelchen.', '“Some universities have the physical capacity to increase enrolment, while others do not. And universities are hoping for a rush of donations to help them get through a difficult time,” said Kelchen.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

This response has been soundly interpreted as India blaming Pakistan for the attack in Kashmir.', 'The Himalayan territory of Kashmir has been a flashpoint between the two countries since they gained independence from British rule in 1947, with each country controlling parts of Kashmir but claiming it in full. Since independence, the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought four wars, three of them over Kashmir.', 'Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, who also serves as deputy prime minister, called the Indian steps “immature and hasty” in a television interview on Wednesday night, .', '“India has not given any evidence [of Pakistani involvement in the attack].” They have not shown any maturity in their response.

There should be no ambiguity that we strongly condemn terrorism,” Asif said.', 'Following the Pahalgam attack, commentary in Indian media and talk among the political leadership has leaned towards launching a military strike on Pakistan, drawing parallels with the2019 Balakot strikes.', 'In February 2019, following an attack in Pulwama, Indian-administered Kashmir, in which more than 40 Indian soldiers were killed, India launched air strikes in Balakot, northern Pakistan, targeting what it called “militant hideouts”.', 'Pakistan said the strikes only hit an uninhabited forest and responded with its own air strikes near Indian military targets, causing no casualties.', 'Both sides also deployed fighter jets and, in an aerial dogfight, an Indian aircraft was shot down. Its pilot, Abhinandan Varthaman, was captured but released two days afterwards.', 'Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also hinted at a “strong response”, reiterating India’s “zero tolerance” policy on terrorism.', '“We will not only reach out to those who have carried out this incident. We will also reach out to those who, sitting behind the scenes, have conspired to commit such nefarious acts on the soil of India,” he said, at the Marshal of the Air Force Arjan Singh Memorial Lecture in New Delhi on April 23.', 'Analysts and security officials in Pakistan say they believe that Indian military actioncould now be possible, but said the country was “ready for any Indian misadventure”.', '“We are maintaining a high level of alertness and vigilance, but unlike India, we don’t want to create any unnecessary hype by talking about our readiness,” a security source told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity, as he has not been authorised to speak on the matter.', '“India is wrong if it thinks there isn’t going to be any tit for tat. However, we are both nuclear-armed countries, and Indian aggression could lead to an irresponsible situation. Both of us should act carefully,” he added.', 'The official further questioned India’s allegation of Pakistani involvement, noting that the attack took place nearly 200km (124 miles) from the Line of Control, the de facto border between the two countries, and highlighted the presence of more than 500,000 Indian security personnel in the Kashmir valley.', 'He also pointed to the recent visit to India by United States Vice President JD Vance, who arrived in the country on Monday with his wife and two children for a four-day visit, taking in a meeting with Prime Minister Modi.', '“How do you think this attack will serve Pakistan, especially with JD Vance being there?” he asked. “Could this attack lead to the liberation of Indian Kashmir? Why won’t Indian authorities take time to look inward and introspect? Will they ever accept their own security shortcomings?”', 'Past skirmishes have previously raised the spectre of war between the two countries, which together have a population exceeding 1.5 billion.', 'Asfandyar Mir, a security analyst specialising in South Asia, said Pakistan is likely to reserve its military response for a contingency in case of Indian action while monitoring how the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty unfolds.', 'The Indus Basin is a lifeline for the populations of Pakistan and India, who rely on the river water flowing from the Himalayas for irrigation and agriculture.', 'However, Mir added that military action increasingly appears to be a likely option for India, similar to 2019, but “potentially more visible”.', 'Referring to the outrage over Tuesday’s attack and calls for a strong response in the Indian media, he said: “The domestic mood in India is strongly trending toward a response. That said, India faces a more acute China challenge than in 2019, so it has to carefully factor that into its response and how an escalation may play out,” he told Al Jazeera.', 'China, India’s northern neighbour, is also one of Pakistan’s closest allies. China and India engaged in aminor conflicton their border in June 2020.', 'On the other hand, Salman Bashir, former Pakistani envoy to New Delhi, told Al Jazeera he believes the decisions made by India’s Cabinet Committee on Security have been based on a “mistaken assumption” about Pakistan’s weakness.', '“These connote a fight-to-the-finish syndrome, which is based on naivete and wishful thinking.

The Trump administrationhas begun its investigationinto imports of medications and the active ingredients needed to make them, saying a lack of that in the US poses a national security threat. It as also threatened sectoral tariffs – that could range from 7.5 percent to 100 percent – in addition to the 145 percent currently in place on China.', 'While pharmaceuticals have been exempt from Trump’s reciprocal tariffs thus far, it’s not clear how long that will last, especially with potential sectoral levies in the pipeline.', 'In the immediate term, there is some insulation between the looming escalated prices and what consumers will pay when they go to pick up their medication at their local pharmacy.', 'Unlike other goods, pharmaceutical prices for consumers are not subject to the same instantaneous market fluctuations. The complex supply chain across the pharmaceutical industry means that there is a lag between tariffs and the impact they might have on patients.', 'At the same time, there are stockpiles at nearly every step of the supply chain. Wholesalers have their own, as do pharmaceutical giants and even the federal government.', '“A lot of these medications, especially ones that are, like, in pill forms, are pretty stable for a long time,” Bruce Y Lee, professor of health policy at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy, told Al Jazeera.', 'In the short term, pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers can eat the spike in costs like they did during the COVID-19 pandemic. That gives pharmaceutical companies and trade groups time to plead with the administration to ensure exceptions from the tariffs continue.', 'India supplies about half of all generic drugs used in the US. However, it depends on China for 80 percent of its active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), the chemical compounds medications are made from.', 'One of the globe’s biggest pharmaceutical giants said it worries any tariff would drive up prices and hurt patient care.', 'In a shareholder meeting, Michel Demare, chairman of the board for AstraZeneca, said, “We still strongly believe that medicines should be exempted from any kind of tariffs because, at the end, it is just harming patients’ health systems and restricting health equity.”', 'AstraZeneca did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for further remarks.', 'Eli Lilly and Johnson and Johnson echoed similar concerns. In the last six months, all three companies have pledged multibillion-dollar investments to ramp up manufacturing as well as research and development in the US.', 'But pharma giants will be able to bite the cost only for so long. Falling stock prices for pharma giants mean that they will need to find other ways to raise the stock price to meet their fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders. Experts say they can do that by renegotiating drug prices higher, depending on the medication. That causes a downstream effect that will lead to higher insurance premiums across the board and higher prices for Americans who rely on these drugs daily.', '“Demand for many pharmaceuticals is not flexible. This is not a consumer good,” Lee pointed out. “When you impose something that increases the cost, like the tariff, you can’t really change the demand … and will ultimately hurt patients”.', 'According to a report from the supply chain analytics company Exiger released last week, the US relies on China for as much as 80 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients. For generic antibiotics, in particular, the dependence is much higher at 90 percent.', 'Because China disproportionately produces more generic drugs, which are 80 to 85 percent cheaper than their brand-name alternatives, tariffs on China will hurt low-income communities the hardest.', '“If there’s a place where you save money, it is generic, and that’s exactly where the increases will be. Generic companies work on the slimmest margins, and they’re just not in a position to absorb [that],” Michael Abrams, partner at Numerof and Associates, a global healthcare consulting firm, told Al Jazeera.', 'Recent analysis from the financial services company ING found that even a 25 percent pharma tariff could force cancer patients to pay as much as $2,000 more for a 24-week supply.', 'Tariffs could force makers of generics to pull out of the US market altogether, says Tom Kraus, vice president of government relations for the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) told Al Jazeera.', '“Imposing tariffs on medications and their ingredients could force generic drug manufacturers with already slim profit margins to drop out of the US market for a given medication, resulting in drug shortages for American patients,” Kraus said.', 'About 90 percent of the medications prescribed in US pharmacies are generic or biosimilar (meaning ingredients that have similar effects),according to a reportfrom the Association of Accessible Medicines published in February.', '“It will cause a lot of reverberations throughout because someone’s going to have to pick up the tab. This will result in a smaller percentage of medication costs being covered by insurance companies, and thus this burden pushed to patients and consumers,” Lee added.', 'Americans are already struggling to meet the costs of healthcare as it is. One in three Americans say they cannot take medications they are prescribed because of the cost, and11 percent of Americanssay they cannot meet their healthcare costs, with a higher burden on Hispanic adults at 18 percent overall.', 'The Congressional Budget Office estimates that7.7 percent of Americansare uninsured, meaning their medical costs are out of pocket. Even for those who do have insurance, public health experts believe that insurance premiums will increase if Trump moves ahead with pharmaceutical tariffs.', '“They’re going to spread that out among anyone paying insurance as a whole. That’s the whole concept of insurance,” Lee said.', 'More expensive drugs are produced stateside or in Europe. Those could also get pricier. There is currently a 10 percent tariff in place impacting these drugs but that could go higher when country-specific tariffs, currently on pause, kick in.', 'Drugs that come out of Europe are more often the blockbuster brand-name medications. Zepbound, Eli Lilly’s weight loss medication, for instance, is made in Ireland. If tariffs kick in there, out-of-pocket costs for US patients on Zepbound could run as much as $1,086.37 for a one-month supply, in contrast to as low as $25 with insurance.', 'In February, the American Hospital Association (AHA), in a letter calling for tariff exceptions for pharmaceuticals, said it is worried that the levies would make existing supply chain strains worse.', '“Despite ongoing efforts to build the domestic supply chain, the US healthcare system relies significantly on international sources for many drugs and devices needed to both care for patients and protect our healthcare workers. Tariffs, as well as any reaction of the countries on whom such tariffs are imposed, could reduce the availability of these life-saving medications and supplies in the US,” the trade group said in a letter to the White House. “US providers import many cancer and cardiovascular medications, immunosuppressives, antibiotics and combination antibiotics from China. For many patients, even a temporary disruption in their access to these needed medications could put them at significant risk of harm, including death.”', 'The AHA declined Al Jazeera’s request for additional comment.', '“Healthcare has a very elaborate logistics chain, and obviously, it varies from product to product, but some of them are very complicated,” Abrams of Numerof and Associates added.', 'For instance, some APIs undergo two or three different processes and not all of them are in the same place before they even come to the US to be incorporated into the final product, he explained.', '“When you take all these relationships and throw them up in the air and see how they come down, inevitably it leads to disruption in supply,” he continued.', 'There are more than 104 active drug shortages in the United States, including common antibiotics like amoxicillin. China is one of the world’s three biggest exporters of the drug, and the US is the largest importer.', 'Another concern about the US’s extreme reliance on China is that the country’s API market is only expected to grow by 7.8 percent over the next five years, according to themarket research firm Modor Intelligence.', 'During the COVID-19 pandemic, when trade essentially halted temporarily, there were concerns that the US did not have enough medications in its strategic reserve to handle a temporary halt. Both Republicans, such as Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton and Democrats, such as former President Joe Biden have long called for less reliance on China for pharmaceuticals as a result.', '“When you have supply chains that are not well diversified or dependent on just particular channels, then that supply chain is fragile and there’s risk,” Lee said.', 'There have long been suggestions from prominent Chinese voices, including economist Li Daokui, that have called on leadership in Beijing to reduce antibiotic exports to the US as a tool in a trade war.', 'But experts agree that Trump’s rapid approach does not give companies time to prepare and thus is putting patients at risk.', 'The ASHP told the White House in a February letter that tariffs “should be applied selectively and dovetail with other incentives to increase domestic production and promote a stable supply chain”.', '“You can’t do it in the 18 months that you’re trying to get it done, OK? And it’s not even exactly a four-year undertaking either,” Abrams added.', 'Some companies have said they will bring more pharmaceutical manufacturing jobs stateside. Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche announced a $50bn investment in the US over the next five years, which will include funds to build research and development facilities and expand existing manufacturing operations.', 'Roche follows Novartis, which announced that it would invest $23bn over the next five years to expand its US infrastructure. That includes thousands of new jobs in seven facilities that will manufacture drugs and APIs.', 'But building and getting plants like these in production will not solve the immediate issue, according to ASHP.', '“It is important to note that building new pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity will take several years. In the meantime, tariffs risk higher prices for those drugs that can pass increased costs to consumers, and shortages for generic drugs that can’t,” Kraus of ASHP continued.', 'The White House did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

There are some 1.4 billion Catholics worldwide, concentrated above all in Europe, the Americas and increasingly in Africa.', 'For this reason, papal funerals tend to attract large numbers of political figures. When Pope John Paul II died in 2005, his funeral attracted some 70 presidents and prime ministers – making it one of the largest gatherings of world leaders in history.', 'Among those to have already confirmed their attendance for Francis’s funeral on Saturday are US President Trump, the UN chief Guterres, and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.', 'Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has no plans to attend, according to the Kremlin, but there will be a delegation from China.', 'Alongside these political figures, there will be large numbers of Catholics and other well-wishers.', 'The Italian government said on Tuesday that it expected at least 200,000 foreigners to travel to Rome for the funeral. Although the Vatican is a sovereign state, it is located in the heart of the Italian capital, and Italy will help manage some elements of the logistics.', 'There is, however, some reason to think that the eventual turnout will be higher than the Italian government’s estimate – the last funeral of a sitting pope, John Paul II, attracted some four million attendees.', 'That said, the number of mourners on Saturday might not quite reach that high. While both popes enjoyed high levels of popularity, John Paul had served for 26 years, compared to Francis’s 12. Moreover, John Paul’s native Poland – where he had a huge number of admirers – was close enough to Italy to facilitate large-scale travel.', 'In 2024, Pope Francis simplified the Rite of Burial for Roman Pontiffs, which lays out the rubrics for papal funerals.', 'According to the new rites, Francis will be buried in a single coffin, rather than the three used by previous popes.', 'Different language will be used, too – during the funeral, the pope will be called “Bishop of Rome”, “Pope”, “Pastor”, or “Roman Pontifex”, with grander titles such as “Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church” now avoided.', 'Mirticeli Medeiros, a Catholic Church historian and Vatican correspondent for Brazil’s GloboNews, told Al Jazeera that “Francis’s simplification of the funeral rituals reflects not only his humility, which was well known, but also his revolution of the institution of the papacy”.', '“He always said that he did not feel comfortable with the idea that the Vatican was the last absolute monarchy of Europe,” Medeiros said. “That is why, from the very beginning, he presented himself as ‘Bishop of Rome’, which for him was the most dignified title – he was a bishop, a pastor and a Christian like any other.”', 'Explaining the changes, Archbishop Diego Ravelli, master of Papal Liturgical Ceremonies, said that the aim was to highlight that the pope’s funeral is “that of a shepherd and disciple of Christ, and not of a powerful man of this world”.', 'Archbishop Ravelli added that it was Francis himself who had stressed the need to “adapt certain rites, so that the celebration of the funeral of the Bishop of Rome might better express the Church’s faith in the risen Christ”.', 'Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, the 91-year-old Italian who is currently dean of the College of Cardinals, is expected to preside over the pope’s funeral mass.', 'He will lead those present in prayers and Bible readings, and will deliver the final commendation and valediction, entrusting the pope’s soul to God.', 'The funeral will be held in a variety of different languages, reflecting the Catholic Church’s international nature and the varied backgrounds of those present.', 'It is likely that – as is the case for most masses of this kind at the Vatican – the main prayers will be said in Latin and Italian, with Bible readings in Italian, Spanish, and English, and a number of shorter prayers in other languages such as Arabic, Polish, and Chinese.', 'After Pope Francis’s funeral, his coffin will be transferred to the Basilica of St Mary Major, a church lying outside the Vatican’s walls that he was particularly fond of visiting.', 'Francis will be the first pope to be buried there since the 1600s, and the first in over 100 years to be buried outside the Vatican.', 'In his final testament, released on Monday, the pope asked that his tomb be “in the ground;simple, without particular ornamentation”, and specified that the only word should be his papal name in Latin: “Franciscus.”', 'A plain gravestone in a church that hasn’t held a pope’s remains in centuries – it’s a fitting final resting place for a man who will be remembered by many for his humility and his independence.', '“After his election in 2013, the pope first appeared in public wearing simple white vestments, as a way to demonstrate his desire for a less ostentatious church”, Christopher White, Vatican correspondent for National Catholic Reporter, told Al Jazeera.', '“So,” White added, “it is fitting that he has stripped down the funeral rites, to ensure that in death he can offer one final lesson in symbolism for a church which, he hopes, will continue on a path toward humility.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

Tuesday’s killings changed that.', 'But what is TRF, and what influence does it wield in Kashmir? And what is at stake for the Indian administration in Kashmir now?', 'On a pleasant, sunny afternoon in the Baisaran meadow of Pahalgam town in Kashmir, touristscame under attackfrom gunmen who emerged from a nearby forest.', 'The men armed with automatic rifles shot at least 26 tourists dead and injured several others. All those killed were men.', 'India’s home minister, Amit Shah, reached Srinagar, the summer capital of the disputed region, as condolences poured in from world leaders, including United States President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote on social media that “those behind this heinous act will be brought to justice … they will not be spared!”', 'By then, TRF had claimed responsibility for the attack, even as the armed attackers who carried out the killings remained on the run.', 'In a message that appeared on Telegram, TRF opposed the granting of residency permits to “outsiders”, who critics say could help India change the demography of the disputed region. “Consequently, violence will be directed toward those attempting to settle illegally,” it said.', 'Though the targets of the attack were tourists — not newly arrived residents making Kashmir their home — the group’s choice of Telegram to claim responsibility did not surprise security officials.', 'TRF is still, at times, referred to as “the virtual front” inside the security apparatus in Kashmir, for that is how it started.', 'After the Indian government unilaterally revoked Kashmir’s partial autonomy in August 2019 and imposed a months-long clampdown, the group first took shape by starting messaging on social media. In reorganising Kashmir, the government also extended domicile status, which allows land owning rights and access to government-sponsored job quotas, to non-locals — the purported justification for the Pahalgam attack.', 'The name The Resistance Front is a break from traditional rebel groups in Kashmir, most of which bear Islamic names. This, Indian intelligence agencies believe, was aimed at projecting “a neutral character, with ‘resistance’ in name focused on Kashmiri nationalism”, said a police officer, who has worked on cases involving armed groups for nearly a decade, requesting anonymity.', 'However, Indian officials have consistently maintained that, in reality, TRF is an offshoot — or just a front — of the Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistan-based armed group. India says Pakistan supports the armed rebellion in Kashmir, a charge denied by Islamabad. Pakistan says it provides only diplomatic and moral support to the Kashmiri people. It also condemned the attack on tourists in Pahalgam.', 'Some Indian officials said they believe Tuesday’s attack may actually have been the handiwork of the Lashkar-e-Taiba, with TRF fronting responsibility to muddy India’s investigations into the killings.', 'By 2020, the group started taking responsibility for minor attacks, including targeted killings of individuals. Its recruits consisted of fighters from an amalgam of splinter rebel groups. Since then, Indian security agencies have busted multiple groups of TRF fighters.', 'But the group survived and grew.', 'By 2022, a majority of the armed fighters killed in gunfights in Kashmir were affiliated with TRF, according to government records. TRF members were increasingly using small arms such as pistols to carry out targeted killings, including those of retired security personnel and people accused of being informers.', 'The group also made headlines that year after it named Kashmiri journalists on a “traitor hit list” for allegedly colluding with the Indian state. At least five of the named journalists resigned immediately, as there is a history of such attacks. Shujaat Bukhari, a prominent Kashmiri journalist and editor of the Rising Kashmir publication, was assassinated on June 14, 2018, outside his office in Srinagar. The Kashmir police have attributed the killing to theLashkar-e-Taiba.', 'In June 2024, TRF also claimed responsibility for an attack on a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims, killing at least nine people and injuring 33, in Jammu’s Reasi area. The bus had plunged into a gorge during the attack.', 'As TRF made its mark with its deadly attacks, it also used a mix of old and new strategies. Its English name stood out, as did its social media usage. But in other ways, it relied on more traditional techniques.', 'Before TRF’s arrival, Kashmiri rebel commanders had, since 2014, increasingly adopted more public personas. Their groups would post videos on social media of their commanders casually walking through apple orchards, playing cricket, or riding a bike in Srinagar. This social media outreach led to a surge in recruitment. Among the commanders who adopted this method was Burhan Wani, whose killing in July 2016 led to an uprising, during which more than 100 civilians were killed in street protests.', 'But after the 2019 crackdown, this approach no longer worked. TRF fighters, the newcomers on the scene, returned to tried and tested ways. “The faces were again hidden; the number of attacks fell, but the intensity became sharper,” said the police officer who requested anonymity.', 'Under the leadership of Mohammad Abbas Sheikh, one of the oldest Kashmiri fighters — he is reported to have joined the rebellion in 1996 — the group focused its attacks on Srinagar.', 'After his killing in 2021, and the killings of many other armed rebels in the subsequent year, TRF retreated with its fighters to jungles higher up in the mountains, a central intelligence official said on condition of anonymity.', 'In January 2023, the Indian government declared TRF a “terrorist organisation”, citing the recruitment of rebels and smuggling of weapons from Pakistan into Kashmir.', 'As more and more TRF fighters were killed by security agencies, their numbers dwindled. The rebels, according to the police and intelligence officials, were well trained but largely stayed in their high-altitude hideouts.', 'Yet, if Indian security and intelligence agencies were caught off guard by the attack, some experts believe that is the outcome of holes in the Modi government’s Kashmir policy.', 'Modi and Home Minister Shah, who is responsible for law and order and widely seen as Modi’s deputy, have repeatedly made claims of “normalcy” in Kashmir since the region’ssemi-autonomous status was revokedin 2019.', 'It was that assurance and the promotion of tourism by the Indian government that drove Kailash Sethi to Kashmir this summer with his family. Now, he is frantically looking to leave the region as soon as possible.', '“We were in Pahalgam just two days ago, at the same place where the attack happened,” Sethi, who is from Jamnagar in the western state of Gujarat, told Al Jazeera from Srinagar. “I cannot tell you how scared I am right now. I just want to take out my family.”', 'On Wednesday, panic gripped tour and travel operators as visitors rushed to cancel their bookings and return home. Traffic jammed the roads to Srinagar airport, and prices to fly out of Kashmir increased by more than 300 percent.', '“There is no normalcy in Kashmir. And this ‘normalcy’ narrative is the most unfortunate thing about the Kashmir policy of this government,” said Ajai Sahni, executive director of South Asia Terrorism Portal, a platform that tracks and analyses armed attacks in South Asia.', '“First, zero militancy in Kashmir is an impossible objective to realise, at least in the absence of a political solution within the state,” said Sahni. “Secondly, the ‘normalcy narrative’ creates a situation where groups are encouraged to engineer attacks.” That, he said, is because they know that “even if a small attack occurs, it is not normal any more”.', 'Apart from occasional attacks, rebel groups had largely spared the tourism industry so far, added Sahni. “This also led to a level of complacency, perhaps, in the security apparatus,” he said, adding that “this is a very abrupt escalation on the part of TRF”.', 'By Tuesday evening, as the dead and injured were brought down on horseback and military vehicles, the police had sealed the resort town of Pahalgam. Several areas in Kashmir, including Srinagar, witnessed a shutdown after traders’ associations and political parties called for collective mourning.', 'Raul, who works in the hospitality sector in Pahalgam and requested he be identified by his first name only, said he remains anxious for the future. “There will be crackdowns and the increased presence of armed forces in the area again,” he said. “Everyone, my clients, just wants to get out of Kashmir.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

Before the 1960s, popes hardly left the Vatican.', 'Leaders across Africa, too, are mourning his death. Kenya’s President William Ruto referred to the late pope as someone who “exemplified servant leadership through his humility, his unwavering commitment to inclusivity and justice, and his deep compassion for the poor and the vulnerable”.', 'Here’s how the late Pope Francis prioritised Africa during his tenure:', 'Pope Francis made five trips to Africa throughout his papacy, during which he visited 10 countries.', 'He opted to visit nations that were in strife and were facing war or low-level conflict. He also focused on those struggling with economic and climatic challenges. The pontiff did not shy away from holding mass in ghettos or kissing the feet of warring leaders in hopes of bringing peace.', 'Those visits modelled those of Pope John Paul II (1980-2005), who visited more than 25 African countries in his 25 years of service, transforming the way the Vatican engaged with the continent. Pope Benedict XVI (2005-2013) visited three African countries over two visits.', 'These are the countries Pope Francis visited and when:', 'The pontiff’s six-day visit to three African countries in November 2015 was replete with colourful welcomes and huge mass events.', 'Then,in the CAR,the pope did the unprecedented: He ventured into a Muslim neighbourhood amid religious tensions in the country that had lasted for months.', 'The PK5 neighbourhood in the capital, Bangui, had been off-limits to Christians before then, but as the pope made his way to a mosque there, crowds of Christians followed him in. People who had lost touch cried as they embraced each other.', 'Pope Francis urged both sides to lay down their arms and called Africa “the continent of hope” in his speeches. The visit would eventually lead to a peace agreement between the warring factions, although true peace would take another five years.', 'The same year, in September, Pope Francis turned his attention to Southern Africa, particularly countries in the Indian Ocean.', 'Amid ongoing conflict and a humanitarian crisis brought on by armed factions looking to control the country, the pope’svisit to the DRCsymbolically called for peace and reconciliation in the troubled central African nation.', 'The DRC, which has the largest number of Catholics in Africa – an estimated 35 million people – was an important one for the pope, who’d had to postpone the trip because of ill health. Congolese showed up in the thousands to welcome him.', 'In South Sudan, the pope called for continued peace between rivals President Salva Kiir and his deputy, Vice President Riek Machar. The country, Africa’s youngest, has been rocky since it gained independence from Sudan in 2011. Immediately after, and until 2013, a civil war broke out between factions loyal to the two leaders, leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands and the displacement of millions of South Sudanese.', 'Five years before he set foot in South Sudan, the pope had expressed an unusual level of humility: He’d lowered himself with great difficulty to kiss the two leaders’ feet while they were on a spiritual retreat to the Vatican. He called on them to stick to signed peace agreements for the sake of the people.', 'Since January, the country has once more been on the brink of conflict. In a letter in late March, at a time when the pope was already encountering more serious health problems, he wrote again to the two leaders, calling for peace and dialogue.', 'Yes, Pope Francis enjoyed cordial relations with different African bishops and their associations. However, he also encountered criticism from some for his stance on same-sex unions.', 'In December 2023, the pope authorised the blessing of same-sex couples, an unprecedented move in the Church. He ordained that such blessings may be carried out as long as they don’t form part of the Church’s regular rituals, and if they are not carried out at the same time as other civil unions.', 'African bishop associations pushed back hard at this. Several countries on the continent are strongly against same-sex or other non-conforming gender categories due to religious and cultural beliefs.', 'One such association was the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar (SECAM), which, in a statement, rejected the rule and described the union of same-sex or non-heterosexual people as “unacceptable”. The group, under the lead of Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo of the DRC, said “these acts…must not be approved under any circumstances.”', 'Bishops in Asia also made similar calls for the Vatican to U-turn on the new ruling.', 'Responding to the criticism, Pope Francis told the Italian newspaper La Stampa that his emphasis was on the blessing of the people involved, not necessarily the union. He said: “We are all sinners: Why then draw up a list of sinners who can enter the Church?”', 'In the case of criticism from Africa, Pope Francis acknowledged the concerns. “For them, homosexuality is something ‘bad’ from a cultural point of view; they don’t tolerate it,” he said.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",

However, Al Jazeera could not independently confirm the statement’s authenticity.', 'The Indian government had stripped Kashmir’s semi-autonomous status in 2019, asserting more federal control and splitting the former state into two union territories.

That’s how we are seeing it. It has come just days after that speech by Pakistan’s army chief,” Tara Kartha, director at the Centre for Land Warfare Studies (CLAWS), a New Delhi-based think tank, said. Kartha, who was formerly an official at India’s National Security Council Secretariat, was referring to last week’s address by Pakistani Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir, where he reiterated his support for the two-nation theory that led to India’s partition in 1947, and affirmed “difference from Hindus”.', 'Kartha, speaking on Tuesday, said the actions in Pahalgam match the tone of Munir’s “invective-loaded” address on April 16. “Only if Pakistan condemns the attack in the strongest terms and promises action against terrorists in the next 48 hours will a serious crisis be averted.”', 'Pakistan did respond in the early hours of Wednesday.', '“We are concerned at the loss of tourists’ lives in an attack in Anantnag district of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir. We extend our condolences to the near ones of the deceased and wish the injured a speedy recovery,” the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. India and Pakistan both claim all of Kashmir, while each controls a part of it.', 'But that statement did little to calm passions in India – as became obvious with New Delhi’s retaliatory measures hours later.', 'Yet, while the Modi government is under\\xa0pressure to act tough against Pakistan, some experts cautioned against an impulsive reaction.', 'India’s relative stability compared with its “highly volatile neighbour” should inform its response, said Saba Naqvi, a veteran political commentator based in New Delhi.', '“As for India, most people here think the BJP regime will simply drop bombs there and everything will be avenged,” she said, referring to Modi’s Hindu majoritarian Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “But it is not as simple as that.”', 'Kashmiri politicians and civil society have condemned the attack, arguing that such actions hurt residents more than anyone else.', '“This is a terrorist act. I don’t think I can define it as anything else. Whoever has done it, only wants to harm Kashmiris, our economy and a sense of political stability that had returned to place in the past couple of months,” Waheed ur Rehman Para, a Kashmiri legislator from the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP), told Al Jazeera.', 'Tourism is an important component of the local economy, contributing nearly 7 percent to its gross domestic product (GDP). A rush of visitors to Kashmir also serves the political messaging of Modi’s BJP that it has succeeded in bringing peace and calm to the region.', 'Yet, even before the Pahalgam attack, things were far from normal in the region. Since 2019, the Indian government has cracked down on political activists and civilians alike, arresting thousands of people under draconian laws that allow it to keep them in detention for lengthy periods without a trial.', 'Last year in October, Kashmir voted to choose its first elected head after nearly a decade.', 'Omar Abdullah, a popular provincial politician who campaigned on the promise of reinstating the lost autonomy, clinched a landslide victory in these polls. But his rule has been severely restricted by the new laws of the union territory, with many powers now held by a federally handpicked lieutenant governor.', 'Still, the Pahalgam attack has brought many hoteliers and tour operators to the defence of tourists and against those behind the killings.', '“This is not acceptable at any cost. What is most difficult, more than anything else, for us at this hour is the heavy human loss this has imposed. Tourism is not the priority at the moment,” said Abdul Wahid Malik, a hotelier based in Pahalgam, and former president of the local hoteliers’ guild.', 'A landslide in Ramban village, a gateway connecting the mountainous Kashmir region with the plains of Jammu, has disrupted traffic in and out of the landlocked valley, pushing airfares higher and making it difficult for fear-stricken tourists to leave the region, following Tuesday’s attack.', 'After learning that a tourist family was stuck, Malik arranged four rooms for them at his hotel. “We are duty-bound to ensure their safety,” he said. “The attack has devastated us.”', 'Tourism and business operators in Kashmir called for a shutdown on Wednesday. Other residents also said they were shocked by the incident.', '“Kashmir is known for being warm and hospitable,” said Nadiya Farooq, 31, a resident of Srinagar.', '“We are devastated by the loss of lives. We want peace and an end to bloodshed. We are grieving.”', 'Leaders from around the world have condemned the attack and have offered condolences.', 'USPresident Donald Trump took to X, calling the news from Kashmir “deeply disturbing”.', '“The United States stands strong with India against Terrorism.

Paid TV does not work as well as other platforms, and it is very segmented,” Punjabi said.', '“With free-to-air, everyone has access.”', 'Punjabi said economic and logistical factors in Indonesia, an archipelago of some 17,000 islands, have helped free-to-air TV to remain popular in the Southeast Asian country despite the rise of streaming services.', '“In other countries, like India, you have a flats system with many people living in one building, so paid TV becomes very cheap. Over here, it is very scattered. With the infrastructure we have, free TV is very practical and easy. You just need an antenna, so it is more affordable and easily accessible,” he said.', '“I thought free-to-air was a sunset market and platform, but in 2020, during COVID, I realised that free-to-air still exists and people are watching it. It is not a dying business, but a sunset business that has been stuck.”', 'James Guild, an assistant professor at Universitas Islam Internasional Indonesia, or Indonesian International Islamic University (UIII), agreed that there is considerable potential for free-to-air TV to expand.', '“There are a lot of places in Indonesia where people lack access to good wi-fi or cannot afford the monthly subscription for a streaming service like Vidio, or can only afford limited data plans and are unable to stream a lot of content,” Guild told Al Jazeera.', '“Old-fashioned television is also still good business, [and] there is certainly still money to be made selling advertising on free-to-air television stations in Indonesia,” Guild said.', 'In 2022, Punjabi made history when he produced KKN di Desa Penari, which eclipsed Titanic to become the highest-grossing film ever shown in Indonesian cinemas.', 'To date, he has also produced seven of Indonesia’s 20 highest-grossing movies and has been widely credited with reviving interest in the genre of Indonesian horror.', 'Punjabi’s family started their entertainment business in Indonesia in the 1980s.', 'He recalls rushing home from school every day so he could watch the raw, unedited footage of the films his family were producing.', 'Punjabi’s grandfather emigrated to Indonesia following the partition of British India in 1947.', 'Like his father, he was born and raised in Indonesia.', '“I’m Hindu, but I’m a proud Indonesian with an Indian background,” he said.', 'But in the late 1980s, when Punjabi was 17, everything came crashing down.', 'There was “a family crisis”,\\xa0 Punjabi said, which resulted in his parents selling their home and “adjusting their lifestyle”.', '“I think my ambition came from that. I never wanted to be like that again. Because you have a certain standard, and then you go down. It hurts and you feel it,” he said.', 'After brief stints working at a pulp and paper factory and a garment factory, Punjabi founded MD Entertainment in 2002.', 'In 2024, he was ranked 34th on Forbes’ list of Indonesia’s 50 richest people, with an estimated net worth of more than $1.5bn.', '“When you are on that list, you feel a kind of pressure, but in a good way,” Punjabi said.', '“To be at that stage, you are thankful, but you have to be more tough, and that is tiring. So that list makes me feel pressured in that way, it makes me motivated to do better, and I hope it doesn’t stop here.”', 'Asked about his legacy, Punjabi said he hopes that MD Entertainment will still be around in a century and will branch out beyond Indonesia.', '“How I am going to do it is still in the pipeline, but there is something iconic that I want to offer audiences, not just in Indonesia or Southeast Asia,” he said.', 'When it comes to sources of inspiration, Punjabi listed Titanic, Slumdog Millionaire,\\xa0My Beautiful Life, The Dark Knight, and Casino Royale among his favourite films.', '“I’m obsessed with James Bond and Die Hard. I am an action freak, and those are the movies that I kept watching. I’ve watched the James Bond movies 50 to 70 times, particularly You Only Live Twice and Octopussy from the 1960s. Casino Royale blew my mind,” he said.', 'As for NET.TV., now called MD TV, Punjabi has ambitious plans to raise the quality of free-to-air TV, which has historically not had the best reputation.', '“I want to change the game in terms of how we tell stories, be it movies, soap operas or series,” he said.', 'Punjabi said free-to-air television in Indonesia has often suffered from poor lighting, sets and locations, cliched narratives, and heavy-handed product placement.', '“I want to change the look and the storytelling. People think the quality is going down, but with my concept, I hope it will bring in audiences,” he said.', '“That is my challenge, and I choose to accept it.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']}\n",
